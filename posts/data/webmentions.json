        "html": "<p> <br /></p>\n\n<h2>\n</h2><p>People argue endlessly about which of the Big Two economic systems is better and fairer, but there’s more out there besides Capitalism and Communism.</p>\n<p>Having witnessed a great many online discussions rapidly decay in a spittle-flecked, frenetic combination of ignorance and strong emotion due to the absence of any concept of the various economic systems that have existed through space and time, aside from the Big Two (of course), it is this author’s fervent hope that endeavoring to shed light upon such systems, even in an incomplete and partial way, will assist the public imagination and improve our national conversation, leading to more creative economic outcomes. Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see! Beyond capitalism lies more than just “it must be Communism,” and it’s worth exploring ideas that have served other human societies in order to conceive new systems for our future.</p>\n<p>First, however, it is prudent to come to adequate agreement as to what those first two words mean.</p>\n<p>These days, it seems that both words – Capitalism and Communism – have come to mean something other than ways of organizing an economy and distributing the goods produced therein. <a href=\"http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa49\">Capitalism</a>, then, relates to an economy based upon the accumulation and investment of particularly large piles of wealth to generate economic returns, a meaning utterly lost when the term has been watered down to something more akin to “freedom” or “warm, good, happy feelings of positivity.” Capitalism <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">isn’t the same</a> as simply having markets or engaging in trade. Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ec9da-c9a6-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\">East India Company</a> in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.</p>\n<p>Likewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\">owned and controlled by the public</a>,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society. In 20th century practice, this has often meant a state-controlled economy, though today’s anarchist-communists envision <a href=\"https://libcom.org/article/anarchist-communism-introduction\">independent, egalitarian communities</a> managing their own economic needs. Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg?resize=300%2C380&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Vintage photograph of a man with bushy, white hair and beard, seated, wearing formal clothes.\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" /></a>Karl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory. Photo by John Jabez Edwin Mayall, colored by Olga Shirnina, courtesy of Wikimedia Commons. CC BY-SA 2.0<p>So, beyond capitalism and communism, what is there? How else could an economy possibly be organized?</p>\n<p>Perhaps the oldest system is the <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/gift-economy\">gift economy</a>. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/culture/hunter-gatherer-inequality-namibia/\">mocked and humbled</a> by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.</p>\n<p>Later came the <a href=\"https://ecotalker.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/totw-palace-economy/\">palace economy</a>. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iraq/article/abs/origins-of-the-templeeconomy-as-seen-in-the-light-of-prehistoric-evidence/E6CED755CA475E624BFCD64BAB3B2212\">temple</a> (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be <a href=\"https://archive.foodfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PB11-Famine-in-North-Korea-Christine-Ahn.pdf\">North Korea’s version of state communism</a>, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).</p>\n<p>You likely heard about the next one in school: <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/Feudalism/\">feudalism</a>, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/15424/the-feudal-society-in-medieval-europe/\">hierarchal</a> and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neofeudalism-the-end-of-capitalism/\">we don’t have to look far</a> for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’</p>\n<p>Indigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised <a href=\"https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/publications/working_papers/1605.pdf\">the potlatch economy</a>. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://distributistreview.com/archive/an-introduction-to-distributism\">Distributism</a> is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to <a href=\"https://modjourn.org/essay/distributism/\">spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible</a>. This could <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e486131a9ec956ab43c1f8e/5e4862202773074a5cd60bb2/5e4862232773074a5cd60de4/1581802019229/wallst.pdf?format=original\">mean</a> a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.</p>\n<p>Socialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2020/05/capitalism-socialism-cooperatives-market-nhs-democracy\">made available alongside and outside</a> of it, funded by public taxation (that is, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/1/12732168/economic-freedom-score-america-welfare-state\">skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy</a> in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.</p>\n<p>As you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.</p>\n<p>Looking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">settle into two</a> opposing and circularly-arguing camps.

        "text": "People argue endlessly about which of the Big Two economic systems is better and fairer, but there’s more out there besides Capitalism and Communism.\nHaving witnessed a great many online discussions rapidly decay in a spittle-flecked, frenetic combination of ignorance and strong emotion due to the absence of any concept of the various economic systems that have existed through space and time, aside from the Big Two (of course), it is this author’s fervent hope that endeavoring to shed light upon such systems, even in an incomplete and partial way, will assist the public imagination and improve our national conversation, leading to more creative economic outcomes. Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see! Beyond capitalism lies more than just “it must be Communism,” and it’s worth exploring ideas that have served other human societies in order to conceive new systems for our future.\nFirst, however, it is prudent to come to adequate agreement as to what those first two words mean.\nThese days, it seems that both words – Capitalism and Communism – have come to mean something other than ways of organizing an economy and distributing the goods produced therein. Capitalism, then, relates to an economy based upon the accumulation and investment of particularly large piles of wealth to generate economic returns, a meaning utterly lost when the term has been watered down to something more akin to “freedom” or “warm, good, happy feelings of positivity.” Capitalism isn’t the same as simply having markets or engaging in trade. Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered East India Company in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.\nLikewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are owned and controlled by the public,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society. In 20th century practice, this has often meant a state-controlled economy, though today’s anarchist-communists envision independent, egalitarian communities managing their own economic needs. Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).\nKarl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory.

How else could an economy possibly be organized?\nPerhaps the oldest system is the gift economy. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been mocked and humbled by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.\nLater came the palace economy. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or temple (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be North Korea’s version of state communism, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).\nYou likely heard about the next one in school: feudalism, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however hierarchal and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, we don’t have to look far for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’\nIndigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised the potlatch economy. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.\nDistributism is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible. This could mean a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.\nSocialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply made available alongside and outside of it, funded by public taxation (that is, skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.\nAs you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.\nLooking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually settle into two opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a situation that could desperately use an injection of fresh ideas, because the system is failing. Sooner than later, we’ll have to figure out how to produce and distribute what people need, beyond capitalism.

Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see! Beyond capitalism lies more than just “it must be Communism,” and it’s worth exploring ideas that have served other human societies in order to conceive new systems for our future.\nFirst, however, it is prudent to come to adequate agreement as to what those first two words mean.\nThese days, it seems that both words – Capitalism and Communism – have come to mean something other than ways of organizing an economy and distributing the goods produced therein. Capitalism, then, relates to an economy based upon the accumulation and investment of particularly large piles of wealth to generate economic returns, a meaning utterly lost when the term has been watered down to something more akin to “freedom” or “warm, good, happy feelings of positivity.” Capitalism isn’t the same as simply having markets or engaging in trade. Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered East India Company in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.\nLikewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are owned and controlled by the public,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society. In 20th century practice, this has often meant a state-controlled economy, though today’s anarchist-communists envision independent, egalitarian communities managing their own economic needs. Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).\nKarl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory.

How else could an economy possibly be organized?\nPerhaps the oldest system is the gift economy. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been mocked and humbled by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.\nLater came the palace economy. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or temple (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be North Korea’s version of state communism, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).\nYou likely heard about the next one in school: feudalism, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however hierarchal and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, we don’t have to look far for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’\nIndigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised the potlatch economy. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.\nDistributism is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible. This could mean a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.\nSocialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply made available alongside and outside of it, funded by public taxation (that is, skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.\nAs you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.\nLooking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually settle into two opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a situation that could desperately use an injection of fresh ideas, because the system is failing. Sooner than later, we’ll have to figure out how to produce and distribute what people need, beyond capitalism.

Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see!

Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ec9da-c9a6-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\">East India Company</a> in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.</p>\n<p>Likewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\">owned and controlled by the public</a>,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society. In 20th century practice, this has often meant a state-controlled economy, though today’s anarchist-communists envision <a href=\"https://libcom.org/article/anarchist-communism-introduction\">independent, egalitarian communities</a> managing their own economic needs. Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage photograph of a man with bushy, white hair and beard, seated, wearing formal clothes.\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" /></a>Karl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory.

How else could an economy possibly be organized?</p>\n<p>Perhaps the oldest system is the <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/gift-economy\">gift economy</a>. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/culture/hunter-gatherer-inequality-namibia/\">mocked and humbled</a> by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.</p>\n<p>Later came the <a href=\"https://ecotalker.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/totw-palace-economy/\">palace economy</a>. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iraq/article/abs/origins-of-the-templeeconomy-as-seen-in-the-light-of-prehistoric-evidence/E6CED755CA475E624BFCD64BAB3B2212\">temple</a> (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be <a href=\"https://archive.foodfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PB11-Famine-in-North-Korea-Christine-Ahn.pdf\">North Korea’s version of state communism</a>, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).</p>\n<p>You likely heard about the next one in school: <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/Feudalism/\">feudalism</a>, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/15424/the-feudal-society-in-medieval-europe/\">hierarchal</a> and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neofeudalism-the-end-of-capitalism/\">we don’t have to look far</a> for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’</p>\n<p>Indigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised <a href=\"https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/publications/working_papers/1605.pdf\">the potlatch economy</a>. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://distributistreview.com/archive/an-introduction-to-distributism\">Distributism</a> is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to <a href=\"https://modjourn.org/essay/distributism/\">spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible</a>. This could <a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e486131a9ec956ab43c1f8e/5e4862202773074a5cd60bb2/5e4862232773074a5cd60de4/1581802019229/wallst.pdf?format=original\">mean</a> a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.</p>\n<p>Socialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2020/05/capitalism-socialism-cooperatives-market-nhs-democracy\">made available alongside and outside</a> of it, funded by public taxation (that is, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/1/12732168/economic-freedom-score-america-welfare-state\">skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy</a> in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.</p>\n<p>As you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.</p>\n<p>Looking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">settle into two</a> opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a situation that could desperately use an injection of fresh ideas, because the system is failing. Sooner than later, we’ll have to figure out how to produce and distribute what people need, beyond capitalism. Let’s start now.</p>\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.legalreader.com/distributism-an-oldnew-economic-answer/\">Distributism: An Old/New Economic Answer</a></p>\n<h2><span>Sources:</span></h2>\n<h6><span><a href=\"http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa49\">History of Capitalism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ec9da-c9a6-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\">Lessons for capitalism from the East India Company</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\">Communism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://libcom.org/article/anarchist-communism-introduction\">Anarchist communism – an introduction</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/gift-economy\">The Gift Economy</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/culture/hunter-gatherer-inequality-namibia/\">Why Envy Might Be Good for Us</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://ecotalker.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/totw-palace-economy/\">TOTW: Palace Economy</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iraq/article/abs/origins-of-the-templeeconomy-as-seen-in-the-light-of-prehistoric-evidence/E6CED755CA475E624BFCD64BAB3B2212\">The Origins of the “Temple-Economy” as seen in the Light of Prehistoric Evidence</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://archive.foodfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PB11-Famine-in-North-Korea-Christine-Ahn.pdf\">Famine and the Future of Food Security in North Korea</a> [PDF]</span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/Feudalism/\">Feudalism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/15424/the-feudal-society-in-medieval-europe/\">The Feudal Society in Medieval Europe</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neofeudalism-the-end-of-capitalism/\">Neofeudalism: The End of Capitalism?</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/publications/working_papers/1605.pdf\">The Potlatch as Fractional Reserve Banking</a> [PDF]</span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://distributistreview.com/archive/an-introduction-to-distributism\">An Introduction to Distributism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://modjourn.org/essay/distributism/\">Distributism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">Neither Capitalism nor Socialism: A Third Alternative</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2020/05/capitalism-socialism-cooperatives-market-nhs-democracy\">Capitalism Isn’t Working.

Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).\nKarl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory.

How else could an economy possibly be organized?\nPerhaps the oldest system is the gift economy. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been mocked and humbled by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.\nLater came the palace economy. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or temple (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be North Korea’s version of state communism, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).\nYou likely heard about the next one in school: feudalism, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however hierarchal and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, we don’t have to look far for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’\nIndigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised the potlatch economy. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.\nDistributism is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible. This could mean a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.\nSocialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply made available alongside and outside of it, funded by public taxation (that is, skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.\nAs you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.\nLooking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually settle into two opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a situation that could desperately use an injection of fresh ideas, because the system is failing. Sooner than later, we’ll have to figure out how to produce and distribute what people need, beyond capitalism.

Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see! Beyond capitalism lies more than just “it must be Communism,” and it’s worth exploring ideas that have served other human societies in order to conceive new systems for our future.</p>\n<p>First, however, it is prudent to come to adequate agreement as to what those first two words mean.</p>\n<p>These days, it seems that both words – Capitalism and Communism – have come to mean something other than ways of organizing an economy and distributing the goods produced therein. <a href=\"http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa49\">Capitalism</a>, then, relates to an economy based upon the accumulation and investment of particularly large piles of wealth to generate economic returns, a meaning utterly lost when the term has been watered down to something more akin to “freedom” or “warm, good, happy feelings of positivity.” Capitalism <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">isn’t the same</a> as simply having markets or engaging in trade. Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ec9da-c9a6-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\">East India Company</a> in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.</p>\n<p>Likewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\">owned and controlled by the public</a>,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society.

Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see! Beyond capitalism lies more than just “it must be Communism,” and it’s worth exploring ideas that have served other human societies in order to conceive new systems for our future.\nFirst, however, it is prudent to come to adequate agreement as to what those first two words mean.\nThese days, it seems that both words – Capitalism and Communism – have come to mean something other than ways of organizing an economy and distributing the goods produced therein. Capitalism, then, relates to an economy based upon the accumulation and investment of particularly large piles of wealth to generate economic returns, a meaning utterly lost when the term has been watered down to something more akin to “freedom” or “warm, good, happy feelings of positivity.” Capitalism isn’t the same as simply having markets or engaging in trade. Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered East India Company in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.\nLikewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are owned and controlled by the public,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society. In 20th century practice, this has often meant a state-controlled economy, though today’s anarchist-communists envision independent, egalitarian communities managing their own economic needs. Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).\nKarl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory.

How else could an economy possibly be organized?\nPerhaps the oldest system is the gift economy. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been mocked and humbled by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.\nLater came the palace economy. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or temple (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be North Korea’s version of state communism, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).\nYou likely heard about the next one in school: feudalism, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however hierarchal and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, we don’t have to look far for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’\nIndigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised the potlatch economy. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.\nDistributism is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible. This could mean a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.\nSocialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply made available alongside and outside of it, funded by public taxation (that is, skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.\nAs you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.\nLooking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually settle into two opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a situation that could desperately use an injection of fresh ideas, because the system is failing. Sooner than later, we’ll have to figure out how to produce and distribute what people need, beyond capitalism.

Past capitalism lies extra than simply “it should be Communism,” and it’s price exploring concepts which have served different human societies as a way to conceive new programs for our future.</p>\n<p>First, nonetheless, it’s prudent to return to sufficient settlement as to what these first two phrases imply.</p>\n<p>Today, it appears that evidently each phrases – Capitalism and Communism – have come to imply one thing aside from methods of organizing an economic system and distributing the products produced therein. <a href=\"http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa49\">Capitalism</a>, then, pertains to an economic system primarily based upon the buildup and funding of significantly giant piles of wealth to generate financial returns, a that means completely misplaced when the time period has been watered right down to one thing extra akin to “freedom” or “heat, good, completely satisfied emotions of positivity.” Capitalism <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">isn’t the same</a> as merely having markets or participating in commerce. Though parts of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval apply of usury (lending cash to be repaid with curiosity), it actually got here into its personal with such improvements because the chartered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ec9da-c9a6-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\">East India Company</a> within the 18th century, which started the method of ravaging the subcontinent for personal revenue.</p>\n<p>Likewise, “communism” has come to imply “dangerous, evil issues that encourage emotions of unhappiness” slightly than “an financial system through which the key technique of manufacturing are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\">owned and controlled by the public</a>,” with the intention of a classless, stateless society. In twentieth century apply, this has typically meant a state-controlled economic system, although as we speak’s anarchist-communists envision <a href=\"https://libcom.org/article/anarchist-communism-introduction\">independent, egalitarian communities</a> managing their very own financial wants. Probably, personal homeowners of capital would favor that the concept of public collectivization of wealth be extensively related to grim, fearful emotions (much like the way in which many economically deprived poors really feel concerning the phrase “capitalism” lately), however such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy aim of making an economic system that works for as many individuals as doable (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the pure world on which our lives rely).</p>\n<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg?ssl=1\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg?resize=300%2C380&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Vintage photograph of a man with bushy, white hair and beard, seated, wearing formal clothes.\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" /></a>Karl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist principle.

How else might an economic system probably be organized?</p>\n<p>Maybe the oldest system is the <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/gift-economy\">gift economy</a>. When people lived collectively in small bands, typically at the least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to stay. Meals was shared; there have been social guidelines about the best way to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those that accrued an excessive amount of or acted too greedily might have been <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/culture/hunter-gatherer-inequality-namibia/\">mocked and humbled</a> by their friends, guaranteeing that assets had been unfold extensively. Items of meals, instruments, or different objects had been repeatedly exchanged, and whereas everybody knew the rating, not reciprocating equally sooner or later was shameful. In case you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper membership, and even Christmas morning, you’ve taken half in a present economic system, the place one of the best ways to speculate one’s extra is in a single’s associates.</p>\n<p>Later got here the <a href=\"https://ecotalker.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/totw-palace-economy/\">palace economy</a>. Better management of a bigger inhabitants enabled central elites to arrange the manufacturing and distribution of products. Land and supplies could also be supplied, resembling within the Inca Empire, the place totally different villages had been assigned totally different sorts of manufacturing. Completed items could be collected at a central location, resembling a palace or <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iraq/article/abs/origins-of-the-templeeconomy-as-seen-in-the-light-of-prehistoric-evidence/E6CED755CA475E624BFCD64BAB3B2212\">temple</a> (since state and spiritual energy had been mingled, a situation some amongst us would favor even now). Authorities would then redistribute the products as they noticed match, whether or not across the kingdom to people who wanted them, as commerce items with different polities, presents to kind alliances, financing a army, or what have you ever. An identical trendy equal is likely to be <a href=\"https://archive.foodfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PB11-Famine-in-North-Korea-Christine-Ahn.pdf\">North Korea’s version of state communism</a>, the place the federal government decides what grains farmers are to develop, and redistributes no matter grain is produced again to the individuals “in keeping with want” (and availability).</p>\n<p>You probably heard concerning the subsequent one in class: <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/Feudalism/\">feudalism</a>, the dominant financial system of medieval Europe, amongst different areas. Land (crucial technique of manufacturing) was owned by the monarch, who lent management of it to the the Aristocracy in trade for the promise of army assist in battle. The Aristocracy lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to combat. Knights then supplied peasantry with land, in trade for labor and a share of produce. The main points and customs diversified from place to position, after all, and the Church sophisticated it much more, however nonetheless <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/15424/the-feudal-society-in-medieval-europe/\">hierarchal</a> and oppressive, feudalism was a comparatively environment friendly reply to the circumstances of the time. These days, <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neofeudalism-the-end-of-capitalism/\">we don’t have to look far</a> for the trendy equal of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their extra rich ‘betters.’</p>\n<p>Indigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised <a href=\"https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/publications/working_papers/1605.pdf\">the potlatch economy</a>. Any chief who needed to stay in that place would accomplish that by ordering a potlatch ceremony and alluring outsiders to attend. By commanding as a lot manufacturing of feast meals and presents as that tribe might afford, and giving it away in abundance through the ceremony, the chief might earn status because the richest and most beneficiant, the rightful large man. As within the present economic system, a psychological tally was saved and reciprocity anticipated, with any shortfall ensuing within the lack of political status. Organized as a manner of allocating political energy, it was additionally an efficient manner of distributing items from these with extra to these with much less.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://distributistreview.com/archive/an-introduction-to-distributism\">Distributism</a> is a lesser-known financial philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Slightly than the technique of manufacturing being concentrated within the fingers of the wealthy, or run by a authorities forms, the primary aim of distributism is to <a href=\"https://modjourn.org/essay/distributism/\">spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible</a>. This might <a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e486131a9ec956ab43c1f8e/5e4862202773074a5cd60bb2/5e4862232773074a5cd60de4/1581802019229/wallst.pdf?format=original\">mean</a> an awesome many mom-and-pop outlets, worker-owned co-ops, small various farms, and unbiased contractors. Positive, the dearth of huge accumulations of capital would imply fewer big companies, however that worth is likely to be price paying if it signifies that everybody had the means to maintain themselves.</p>\n<p>Socialism has grow to be as emotionally loaded a time period as capitalism or communism, however what’s it actually? Opinions differ, however within the democratic socialist, Nordic mannequin held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s nonetheless a capitalist, market economic system. A few of the most important human wants, which aren’t all the time met by the market, are merely <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2020/05/capitalism-socialism-cooperatives-market-nhs-democracy\">made available alongside and outside</a> of it, funded by public taxation (that’s, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/1/12732168/economic-freedom-score-america-welfare-state\">skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy</a> as a way to make it serve extra individuals). Main examples could be the British Nationwide Well being Service, social safety funds to the aged, or state-owned banks that don’t must function at a revenue as a result of their mission is extra human-centric.</p>\n<p>As you may see, past capitalism and communism lies a formidable array of different methods to stay. In apply, no single financial system takes care of all wants completely. We stay in such a combination, the place we may match for a capitalist, obtain meals help advantages (SNAP) to subsidize an inadequate wage, commerce child garments with a mothers’ group, and make the most of a group backyard plot or CSA share.</p>\n<p>Wanting round, nonetheless, it’s simple to see that the dominant type of American capitalism isn’t working for everybody. There are homeless individuals and people-less houses. Huge quantities of meals are wasted, but there are hungry individuals. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. More and more, individuals are impatient to discover a higher manner, though their imaginations often <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">settle into two</a> opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a scenario that might desperately use an injection of recent concepts, as a result of the system is failing. Earlier than later, we’ll have to determine the best way to produce and distribute what individuals want, past capitalism. Let’s begin now.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.legalreader.com/distributism-an-oldnew-economic-answer/\">Distributism: An Old/New Economic Answer</a></p>\n<h2><span>Sources:</span></h2>\n<h6><span><a href=\"http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa49\">History of Capitalism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ec9da-c9a6-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\">Lessons for capitalism from the East India Company</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\">Communism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://libcom.org/article/anarchist-communism-introduction\">Anarchist communism – an introduction</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/gift-economy\">The Gift Economy</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/culture/hunter-gatherer-inequality-namibia/\">Why Envy Might Be Good for Us</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://ecotalker.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/totw-palace-economy/\">TOTW: Palace Economy</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iraq/article/abs/origins-of-the-templeeconomy-as-seen-in-the-light-of-prehistoric-evidence/E6CED755CA475E624BFCD64BAB3B2212\">The Origins of the “Temple-Economy” as seen in the Light of Prehistoric Evidence</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://archive.foodfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PB11-Famine-in-North-Korea-Christine-Ahn.pdf\">Famine and the Future of Food Security in North Korea</a> [PDF]</span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/Feudalism/\">Feudalism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/15424/the-feudal-society-in-medieval-europe/\">The Feudal Society in Medieval Europe</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neofeudalism-the-end-of-capitalism/\">Neofeudalism: The End of Capitalism?</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/publications/working_papers/1605.pdf\">The Potlatch as Fractional Reserve Banking</a> [PDF]</span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://distributistreview.com/archive/an-introduction-to-distributism\">An Introduction to Distributism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://modjourn.org/essay/distributism/\">Distributism</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">Neither Capitalism nor Socialism: A Third Alternative</a></span></h6>\n<h6><span><a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2020/05/capitalism-socialism-cooperatives-market-nhs-democracy\">Capitalism Isn’t Working.

Capitalism, then, pertains to an economic system primarily based upon the buildup and funding of significantly giant piles of wealth to generate financial returns, a that means completely misplaced when the time period has been watered right down to one thing extra akin to “freedom” or “heat, good, completely satisfied emotions of positivity.” Capitalism isn’t the same as merely having markets or participating in commerce. Though parts of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval apply of usury (lending cash to be repaid with curiosity), it actually got here into its personal with such improvements because the chartered East India Company within the 18th century, which started the method of ravaging the subcontinent for personal revenue.\nLikewise, “communism” has come to imply “dangerous, evil issues that encourage emotions of unhappiness” slightly than “an financial system through which the key technique of manufacturing are owned and controlled by the public,” with the intention of a classless, stateless society. In twentieth century apply, this has typically meant a state-controlled economic system, although as we speak’s anarchist-communists envision independent, egalitarian communities managing their very own financial wants. Probably, personal homeowners of capital would favor that the concept of public collectivization of wealth be extensively related to grim, fearful emotions (much like the way in which many economically deprived poors really feel concerning the phrase “capitalism” lately), however such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy aim of making an economic system that works for as many individuals as doable (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the pure world on which our lives rely).\nKarl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist principle.

How else might an economic system probably be organized?\nMaybe the oldest system is the gift economy. When people lived collectively in small bands, typically at the least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to stay. Meals was shared; there have been social guidelines about the best way to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those that accrued an excessive amount of or acted too greedily might have been mocked and humbled by their friends, guaranteeing that assets had been unfold extensively. Items of meals, instruments, or different objects had been repeatedly exchanged, and whereas everybody knew the rating, not reciprocating equally sooner or later was shameful. In case you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper membership, and even Christmas morning, you’ve taken half in a present economic system, the place one of the best ways to speculate one’s extra is in a single’s associates.\nLater got here the palace economy. Better management of a bigger inhabitants enabled central elites to arrange the manufacturing and distribution of products. Land and supplies could also be supplied, resembling within the Inca Empire, the place totally different villages had been assigned totally different sorts of manufacturing. Completed items could be collected at a central location, resembling a palace or temple (since state and spiritual energy had been mingled, a situation some amongst us would favor even now). Authorities would then redistribute the products as they noticed match, whether or not across the kingdom to people who wanted them, as commerce items with different polities, presents to kind alliances, financing a army, or what have you ever. An identical trendy equal is likely to be North Korea’s version of state communism, the place the federal government decides what grains farmers are to develop, and redistributes no matter grain is produced again to the individuals “in keeping with want” (and availability).\nYou probably heard concerning the subsequent one in class: feudalism, the dominant financial system of medieval Europe, amongst different areas. Land (crucial technique of manufacturing) was owned by the monarch, who lent management of it to the the Aristocracy in trade for the promise of army assist in battle. The Aristocracy lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to combat. Knights then supplied peasantry with land, in trade for labor and a share of produce. The main points and customs diversified from place to position, after all, and the Church sophisticated it much more, however nonetheless hierarchal and oppressive, feudalism was a comparatively environment friendly reply to the circumstances of the time. These days, we don’t have to look far for the trendy equal of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their extra rich ‘betters.’\nIndigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised the potlatch economy. Any chief who needed to stay in that place would accomplish that by ordering a potlatch ceremony and alluring outsiders to attend. By commanding as a lot manufacturing of feast meals and presents as that tribe might afford, and giving it away in abundance through the ceremony, the chief might earn status because the richest and most beneficiant, the rightful large man. As within the present economic system, a psychological tally was saved and reciprocity anticipated, with any shortfall ensuing within the lack of political status. Organized as a manner of allocating political energy, it was additionally an efficient manner of distributing items from these with extra to these with much less.\nDistributism is a lesser-known financial philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Slightly than the technique of manufacturing being concentrated within the fingers of the wealthy, or run by a authorities forms, the primary aim of distributism is to spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible. This might mean an awesome many mom-and-pop outlets, worker-owned co-ops, small various farms, and unbiased contractors. Positive, the dearth of huge accumulations of capital would imply fewer big companies, however that worth is likely to be price paying if it signifies that everybody had the means to maintain themselves.\nSocialism has grow to be as emotionally loaded a time period as capitalism or communism, however what’s it actually? Opinions differ, however within the democratic socialist, Nordic mannequin held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s nonetheless a capitalist, market economic system. A few of the most important human wants, which aren’t all the time met by the market, are merely made available alongside and outside of it, funded by public taxation (that’s, skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy as a way to make it serve extra individuals). Main examples could be the British Nationwide Well being Service, social safety funds to the aged, or state-owned banks that don’t must function at a revenue as a result of their mission is extra human-centric.\nAs you may see, past capitalism and communism lies a formidable array of different methods to stay. In apply, no single financial system takes care of all wants completely. We stay in such a combination, the place we may match for a capitalist, obtain meals help advantages (SNAP) to subsidize an inadequate wage, commerce child garments with a mothers’ group, and make the most of a group backyard plot or CSA share.\nWanting round, nonetheless, it’s simple to see that the dominant type of American capitalism isn’t working for everybody. There are homeless individuals and people-less houses. Huge quantities of meals are wasted, but there are hungry individuals. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. More and more, individuals are impatient to discover a higher manner, though their imaginations often settle into two opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a scenario that might desperately use an injection of recent concepts, as a result of the system is failing. Earlier than later, we’ll have to determine the best way to produce and distribute what individuals want, past capitalism.

Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see! Beyond capitalism lies more than just “it must be Communism,” and it’s worth exploring ideas that have served other human societies in order to conceive new systems for our future.</p>\n<p>First, however, it is prudent to come to adequate agreement as to what those first two words mean.</p>\n<p>These days, it seems that both words – Capitalism and Communism – have come to mean something other than ways of organizing an economy and distributing the goods produced therein. <a href=\"http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa49\">Capitalism</a>, then, relates to an economy based upon the accumulation and investment of particularly large piles of wealth to generate economic returns, a meaning utterly lost when the term has been watered down to something more akin to “freedom” or “warm, good, happy feelings of positivity.” Capitalism <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">isn’t the same</a> as simply having markets or engaging in trade. Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1ec9da-c9a6-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0\">East India Company</a> in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.</p>\n<p>Likewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/communism\">owned and controlled by the public</a>,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society. In 20th century practice, this has often meant a state-controlled economy, though today’s anarchist-communists envision <a href=\"https://libcom.org/article/anarchist-communism-introduction\">independent, egalitarian communities</a> managing their own economic needs. Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Karl_Marx_1875.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage photograph of a man with bushy, white hair and beard, seated, wearing formal clothes.\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" /></a>Karl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory.

How else could an economy possibly be organized?</p>\n<p>Perhaps the oldest system is the <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/gift-economy\">gift economy</a>. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been <a href=\"https://www.sapiens.org/culture/hunter-gatherer-inequality-namibia/\">mocked and humbled</a> by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.</p>\n<p>Later came the <a href=\"https://ecotalker.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/totw-palace-economy/\">palace economy</a>. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iraq/article/abs/origins-of-the-templeeconomy-as-seen-in-the-light-of-prehistoric-evidence/E6CED755CA475E624BFCD64BAB3B2212\">temple</a> (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be <a href=\"https://archive.foodfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/PB11-Famine-in-North-Korea-Christine-Ahn.pdf\">North Korea’s version of state communism</a>, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).</p>\n<p>You likely heard about the next one in school: <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/Feudalism/\">feudalism</a>, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however <a href=\"https://www.worldhistory.org/image/15424/the-feudal-society-in-medieval-europe/\">hierarchal</a> and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/neofeudalism-the-end-of-capitalism/\">we don’t have to look far</a> for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’</p>\n<p>Indigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised <a href=\"https://www.law.gmu.edu/assets/files/publications/working_papers/1605.pdf\">the potlatch economy</a>. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://distributistreview.com/archive/an-introduction-to-distributism\">Distributism</a> is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to <a href=\"https://modjourn.org/essay/distributism/\">spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible</a>. This could <a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e486131a9ec956ab43c1f8e/5e4862202773074a5cd60bb2/5e4862232773074a5cd60de4/1581802019229/wallst.pdf?format=original\">mean</a> a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.</p>\n<p>Socialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2020/05/capitalism-socialism-cooperatives-market-nhs-democracy\">made available alongside and outside</a> of it, funded by public taxation (that is, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/1/12732168/economic-freedom-score-america-welfare-state\">skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy</a> in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.</p>\n<p>As you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.</p>\n<p>Looking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually <a href=\"https://news.mikecallicrate.com/gods-and-radicals-neither-capitalism-nor-socialism-a-third-alternative/\">settle into two</a> opposing and circularly-arguing camps.

Many of the loudest American voices seem attached to minds which can only think in binary terms: white/black, Democrat/Republican, Capitalist/Communist, freedom/slavery, good/evil. How much more there is, for those who care to see! Beyond capitalism lies more than just “it must be Communism,” and it’s worth exploring ideas that have served other human societies in order to conceive new systems for our future.\nFirst, however, it is prudent to come to adequate agreement as to what those first two words mean.\nThese days, it seems that both words – Capitalism and Communism – have come to mean something other than ways of organizing an economy and distributing the goods produced therein. Capitalism, then, relates to an economy based upon the accumulation and investment of particularly large piles of wealth to generate economic returns, a meaning utterly lost when the term has been watered down to something more akin to “freedom” or “warm, good, happy feelings of positivity.” Capitalism isn’t the same as simply having markets or engaging in trade. Although elements of capitalism are evident in, say, the forbidden medieval practice of usury (lending money to be repaid with interest), it really came into its own with such innovations as the chartered East India Company in the 18th century, which began the process of ravaging the subcontinent for private profit.\nLikewise, “communism” has come to mean “bad, evil things that inspire feelings of unhappiness” rather than “an economic system in which the major means of production are owned and controlled by the public,” with the aim of a classless, stateless society. In 20th century practice, this has often meant a state-controlled economy, though today’s anarchist-communists envision independent, egalitarian communities managing their own economic needs. Doubtless, private owners of capital would prefer that the idea of public collectivization of wealth be widely associated with grim, fearful feelings (similar to the way many economically disadvantaged poors feel about the word “capitalism” these days), but such emotional redefinition does little to advance the worthy goal of creating an economy that works for as many people as possible (and, importantly, doesn’t destroy the natural world on which our lives depend).\nKarl Marx, acknowledged father of revolutionary communist theory.

How else could an economy possibly be organized?\nPerhaps the oldest system is the gift economy. When humans lived together in small bands, often at least partially nomadic, one depended upon one’s tribe to live. Food was shared; there were social rules about how to parcel out a hunter’s kill. Those who accumulated too much or acted too greedily may have been mocked and humbled by their peers, ensuring that resources were spread widely. Gifts of food, tools, or other objects were regularly exchanged, and while everyone knew the score, not reciprocating similarly at some point was shameful. If you’ve ever attended a seed swap, a supper club, or even Christmas morning, you’ve taken part in a gift economy, where the best way to invest one’s excess is in one’s friends.\nLater came the palace economy. Greater control of a larger population enabled central elites to organize the production and distribution of goods. Land and materials may be provided, such as in the Inca Empire, where different villages were assigned different kinds of production. Finished goods would be collected at a central location, such as a palace or temple (since state and religious power were mingled, a condition some among us would prefer even now). Authorities would then redistribute the goods as they saw fit, whether around the kingdom to those that needed them, as trade goods with other polities, gifts to form alliances, financing a military, or what have you. A similar modern equivalent might be North Korea’s version of state communism, where the government decides what grains farmers are to grow, and redistributes whatever grain is produced back to the people “according to need” (and availability).\nYou likely heard about the next one in school: feudalism, the dominant economic system of medieval Europe, among other regions. Land (the most important means of production) was owned by the monarch, who lent control of it to the nobility in exchange for the promise of military support in war. Nobility lent smaller parcels to knights, who promised to fight. Knights then provided peasantry with land, in exchange for labor and a share of produce. The details and customs varied from place to place, of course, and the Church complicated it even more, but however hierarchal and oppressive, feudalism was a relatively efficient answer to the circumstances of the time. Nowadays, we don’t have to look far for the modern equivalent of a low-mobility landless underclass who serve their more wealthy ‘betters.’\nIndigenous tribes of the salmon-rich Pacific Northwest devised the potlatch economy. Any chief who wanted to remain in that position would do so by ordering a potlatch ceremony and inviting outsiders to attend. By commanding as much production of feast foods and gifts as that tribe could afford, and giving it away in abundance during the ceremony, the chief could earn prestige as the richest and most generous, the rightful big man. As in the gift economy, a mental tally was kept and reciprocity expected, with any shortfall resulting in the loss of political prestige. Organized as a way of allocating political power, it was also an effective way of distributing goods from those with more to those with less.\nDistributism is a lesser-known economic philosophy with its roots in Catholicism. Rather than the means of production being concentrated in the hands of the rich, or run by a government bureaucracy, the main goal of distributism is to spread the ownership of property and the means of production as widely as possible. This could mean a great many mom-and-pop shops, worker-owned co-ops, small diverse farms, and independent contractors. Sure, the lack of vast accumulations of capital would mean fewer giant corporations, but that price might be worth paying if it means that everyone had the means to sustain themselves.\nSocialism has become as emotionally loaded a term as capitalism or communism, but what is it really? Opinions vary, but in the democratic socialist, Nordic model held up by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, there’s still a capitalist, market economy. Some of the most essential human needs, which aren’t always met by the market, are simply made available alongside and outside of it, funded by public taxation (that is, skimming a bit of the productivity off of a capitalist economy in order to make it serve more people). Major examples would be the British National Health Service, social security payments to the elderly, or state-owned banks that do not need to operate at a profit because their mission is more human-centric.\nAs you can see, beyond capitalism and communism lies an impressive array of other ways to live. In practice, no single economic system takes care of all needs perfectly. We live in such a mix, where we may work for a capitalist, receive food assistance benefits (SNAP) to subsidize an insufficient wage, trade baby clothes with a moms’ group, and take advantage of a community garden plot or CSA share.\nLooking around, however, it’s easy to see that the dominant form of American capitalism isn’t working for everyone. There are homeless people and people-less homes. Vast amounts of food are wasted, yet there are hungry people. We’re destroying the landbase and creating mountains of trash. Increasingly, people are impatient to find a better way, although their imaginations usually settle into two opposing and circularly-arguing camps. It’s a situation that could desperately use an injection of fresh ideas, because the system is failing. Sooner than later, we’ll have to figure out how to produce and distribute what people need, beyond capitalism.

        "html": "<p>Today I saw something at <a href=\"https://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/index\">DataConnect</a> that got me very excited. Mainly because it’s work I’d like to re-use in a future work project, but also because it’s work that combined some areas I’ve got skills in.</p>\n\n<p>The session was called <a href=\"https://dataconnect.api.gov.uk/dc22/#3:00pm-to-3:30pm-Searching-for-data,-not-just-for-datasets\">‘Searching for data, not just for datasets’</a> and is looking at making it easier to search for data. For example, if you want to answer the question ‘How many cars did the UK export last year?’, wouldn’t it be nice to search for <em>that</em>? You know, instead of having to</p>\n\n<ul><li>find out which organisation publishes data about cars and where</li>\n  <li>wonder whether their datasets about cars include data about exports too</li>\n  <li>find the statistical release for the year you’re interested in</li>\n  <li>get the data, work out that someone else entirely publishes data about exports</li>\n  <li>bang the keyboard and start looking again</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/robsteranium\">Robin</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rossbowen\">Ross</a> showed how they’d been tinkering with Elasticsearch to make it return results from datasets in response to natural language queries (see the <a href=\"https://search-prototype.gss-data.org.uk\">prototype</a>). For a few queries I tried, the results it returned were iffy, but they’re collecting feedback on the results. (We systemised collecting feedback on the GOV.UK Search team and built a <a href=\"https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-search-relevance-tool\">search relevance tool</a> to help, so I shared that with them.)</p>\n\n<p>They’re also working on making those results more findable by surfacing ontologies and classifications (in RDF) that describe the data to Google (in JSON-LD) – part of the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/\">Data on the Web Best Practices</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data\">how Google understands structured data</a>.</p>\n\n<p>All of this got me excited because people use data (and other information) to answer questions. And Robin and Ross are working on making those answers more findable. Making answers to common research questions more findable is an area I expect to have to look at soon-ish.</p>\n\n<p>Making those answers more findable inside a product will help our existing users, but making the answers findable on the web would be a <a href=\"https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-loops\">growth loop</a>. It would help us find new prospective users and help support our users’ community of practice.</p>\n\n<p>I know that sounds like VC-backed, rocketship startup bullshit, so I should point out that it wouldn’t only benefit us. It would benefit the public good because these are common research questions, and people are already looking for our data to answer those. It shouldn’t be an arcane process to find this stuff.</p>\n\n<p>To nab from Maggie Appleton’s <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/block-data\">talk on data blocks</a>: better user experiences leads to better data science which leads to better decision-making tools.</p>\n\n<p><em>P.S. This note is squarely aimed at my future self, so that I come back to it if/when that project starts. But if this interests you too, drop me a line. Let’s chat!</em></p>\n\n<h2>Some history, for context</h2>\n\n<p>While hanging out some washing this evening, it occurred to me why I was so interested in this. TL;DR: I’ve got intellectual skin in the game. These problems have been part of my work for the last 8 years.</p>\n\n<p>This stuff first interested me around 2014 or 2015 when I was working at <a href=\"https://porism.com\">Porism</a>. I was tasked with increasing engagement with a reporting tool they’d built for councils, which helps council officers get statistical data about the people living in the council’s boundaries. The data helps support policy decisions and service design, so making it easier for people to use that data was a thing on my plate.</p>\n\n<p>One issue was helping people get to grips with the tool.

        "text": "Today I saw something at DataConnect that got me very excited. Mainly because it’s work I’d like to re-use in a future work project, but also because it’s work that combined some areas I’ve got skills in.\n\nThe session was called ‘Searching for data, not just for datasets’ and is looking at making it easier to search for data. For example, if you want to answer the question ‘How many cars did the UK export last year?’, wouldn’t it be nice to search for that? You know, instead of having to\n\nfind out which organisation publishes data about cars and where\n  wonder whether their datasets about cars include data about exports too\n  find the statistical release for the year you’re interested in\n  get the data, work out that someone else entirely publishes data about exports\n  bang the keyboard and start looking again\nRobin and Ross showed how they’d been tinkering with Elasticsearch to make it return results from datasets in response to natural language queries (see the prototype). For a few queries I tried, the results it returned were iffy, but they’re collecting feedback on the results. (We systemised collecting feedback on the GOV.UK Search team and built a search relevance tool to help, so I shared that with them.)\n\nThey’re also working on making those results more findable by surfacing ontologies and classifications (in RDF) that describe the data to Google (in JSON-LD) – part of the Data on the Web Best Practices and how Google understands structured data.\n\nAll of this got me excited because people use data (and other information) to answer questions. And Robin and Ross are working on making those answers more findable. Making answers to common research questions more findable is an area I expect to have to look at soon-ish.\n\nMaking those answers more findable inside a product will help our existing users, but making the answers findable on the web would be a growth loop. It would help us find new prospective users and help support our users’ community of practice.\n\nI know that sounds like VC-backed, rocketship startup bullshit, so I should point out that it wouldn’t only benefit us. It would benefit the public good because these are common research questions, and people are already looking for our data to answer those. It shouldn’t be an arcane process to find this stuff.\n\nTo nab from Maggie Appleton’s talk on data blocks: better user experiences leads to better data science which leads to better decision-making tools.\n\nP.S. This note is squarely aimed at my future self, so that I come back to it if/when that project starts. But if this interests you too, drop me a line. Let’s chat!\n\nSome history, for context\n\nWhile hanging out some washing this evening, it occurred to me why I was so interested in this. TL;DR: I’ve got intellectual skin in the game. These problems have been part of my work for the last 8 years.\n\nThis stuff first interested me around 2014 or 2015 when I was working at Porism. I was tasked with increasing engagement with a reporting tool they’d built for councils, which helps council officers get statistical data about the people living in the council’s boundaries. The data helps support policy decisions and service design, so making it easier for people to use that data was a thing on my plate.\n\nOne issue was helping people get to grips with the tool. It’s pretty powerful, you can answer a lot of questions with it, but people found it hard to get started or to know how to ask their question. Engagement suffered as a result. There were lots of drop-downs and query builders and the like. The interface didn’t match users’ initial mental models.\n\nBut what makes the tool powerful are the data standards behind it all, how it links together (for example)\n\nthe concept of homelessness\n  services related to homelessness\n  legal duties related to homelessness\n  data about homelessness\nand links all that to other useful data like\n\nthe age of homeless people in your area\n  the number of people in different age ranges in your area\nso that you can do some analysis.\nThe problem was all about making answers to questions findable, but by the time I got close to having the skills to answer it (through product management and user-centred design), I’d moved on to work at GDS.\n\nWhile at GDS, I looked after GOV.UK’s site search for a year. I wrote about how we were going to make site search work smarter for users in order to make results more relevant to a user’s query. It meant I got pretty deep into indexing strategies, taxonomies, and the similarity of words. But we looked at interaction patterns and common components in search experiences too.

Like: Why do our brains work the way they do?</p>\n<p>Two years ago, <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020?_ga=2.170070816.1891439336.1663612814-336533442.1635866663#technology-already-visited-feeling\">we asked</a> how you feel when you search for an answer and find a purple link—that is, a previously-clicked one. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/19/searching-for-answers-and-finding-purple-links-youre-not-alone/\">Fifty-two percent</a> of you described your reaction as “Hello, old friend”: meaning you’ve searched for and located this information before. Maybe you’re trying to remember <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/\">how to exit Vim (again)</a>, or maybe you just need to grab a specific regex. Either way, that purple link is reassuring—and, perhaps, exactly what you were looking for.</p>\n<p>With more than half of developers greeting purple links like old friends (and another 16% reacting with amusement), it was apparent that people were visiting the same questions repeatedly. In fact, we found that <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/06/22/asked-and-answered-the-results-for-the-2022-developer-survey-are-here/\">62%</a> of Stack Overflow’s regular users visited the same question more than once in a three-month span. </p>\n<p>Clearly, many of us are eager to outsource the work of information recall by treating external information repositories (especially those rich in user-generated content, such as Stack Overflow and Reddit) as second brains: personal knowledge management systems supported by technology.</p>\n<p>This got us thinking: Is this an effective use of brainpower? Does the space we free up by deploying a second brain get used productively for something else? Or is relying on a second brain a lazy habit that leaves us less knowledgeable, capable of making fewer connections?</p>\n<p>When I was doing my doctoral work in English and new media studies, I had a tendency to use Wikipedia to keep track of high-level definitions and straightforward details, like when a book was published or when a historical event happened. The definition of “epistemology” stubbornly refused to stick in my head, as did the year Ray Bradbury first published “<a href=\"http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/AST389/ASoundofThunder.pdf\">A Sound of Thunder</a>,” so I found myself searching for this information once a week or so, clicking that friendly purple link every time.</p>\n<p>Another example: I’ve been making the same oatmeal cookie recipe for years, but I have yet to memorize it; I just Google it whenever I have a craving. Effectively, I rely on the search bar and the purple link to remember the recipe for me.</p>\n<p>Why is it easier or more expedient to call up the same information over and over again, rather than committing it to memory? What does our dependence on second brains tell us about the way we learn and work? And for developers, who are constantly deluged with new and complex information, how can the right second brain help your original brain work better?</p>\n<h2><span>What is a second brain?</span></h2>\n<p>A second brain is a personal knowledge management system, especially one enabled by technology. The term is often credited to thought leader and author Tiago Forte, whose <a href=\"https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/\">Building a Second Brain</a> course has done a lot to popularize the concept. (These <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/basb\">illustrated notes</a> do a great job of summarizing the course material.) More specifically…</p>\n<h3><span>A second brain is a way of capturing and organizing information to realize its value</span></h3>\n<p>A second brain helps you get a handle on the volume and complexity of information you’re exposed to at virtually all times, with the eventual goal of translating that knowledge into something useful. This is especially critical for developers and other people whose work involves constant exposure to an ever-expanding pool of complex, technical information. Without help from the structures and technologies that comprise a second brain, you can’t absorb or remember the information you’re immersed in, much less call up that information when you might need it to solve a future problem or kick off a new project.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure.</p>\n<p>Albus Dumbledore</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<img width=\"420\" height=\"630\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/rssfeeds.cloudsite.builders/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pensieve-1-420x630-1.jpeg?resize=420%2C630&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Pensieve 1 420x630 1\" title=\"Two heads are better than one: What second brains say about how developers work 1\" />\n<img width=\"420\" height=\"630\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/rssfeeds.cloudsite.builders/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pensieve-1-420x630-1.jpeg?resize=420%2C630&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Pensieve 1 420x630 1\" title=\"Two heads are better than one: What second brains say about how developers work 1\" />\nHarshLight from San Jose, CA, USA, CC BY 2.0 <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0\">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons\n<p>In the <em>Harry Potter </em>series, Dumbledore’s <a href=\"https://tenor.com/bkvFW.gif\">Pensieve</a> serves a second-brain function, storing disconnected thoughts and memories and shaping them into coherent patterns to inform actions and decisions. “One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure,” explains Dumbledore. “It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.”</p>\n<h3><span>A second brain reduces cognitive load by doing your thinking and remembering for you</span></h3>\n<p>Think of a second brain as <a href=\"https://aseemthakar.com/how-to-build-a-second-brain-as-a-software-developer/\">an extension of your mind</a>: somewhere you can offload cognitive work so you don’t have to struggle to remember information or put it to good use. Like Sherlock Holmes’s <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-memory-factory/202105/use-sherlock-holmes-mind-palace-technique-improve-your-memory\">mind palace</a>, a second brain is a system for collecting, storing, and curating the tide of information that continually washes over us. “It’s a way of ensuring that the ludicrous amount of information we have to deal with day-to-day stops bouncing around our heads and is recorded somewhere where we can make sense of it in the long term,” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mpBC83l1dY\">explains</a> Stack Overflow developer advocate and evangelist Matt Kiernander. </p>\n<h3><span>A second brain is built on digital technology</span></h3>\n<p>It’s certainly possible to cobble together a second brain using manual methods, from a notebook to a filing cabinet to a wall plastered with sticky notes. In college, I took notes in the margins of secondhand books as I read, blithely assuming I would remember what my scribbled abbreviations meant (spoiler: I would not, nor would the bookstore buy back any of my books).</p>\n<p>None of these analog methods is scalable, portable, searchable, or capable of handling data in any format—all essential qualities in the kind of second brain you need. Unless you have access to a Pensieve, I suppose, a digital second brain is far and away the best and most natural choice for most of us who sit in front of computers all day. Your second brain must be: </p>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Scalable</strong>, so you can capture and preserve a virtually unlimited amount of information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Capable of storing and organizing data in various formats</strong>, from images to videos to chunks of code.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Portable</strong>, to permit quick capture and editing of information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Searchable</strong>, so you can easily pull up the knowledge you need when you need it.</li>\n</ul><h4><span>What platforms are developers using as their second brains?</span></h4>\n<p>We’re awfully proud of the fact that <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/19/searching-for-answers-and-finding-purple-links-youre-not-alone/\">90%</a> of developers turn to Stack Overflow when they get stuck, often via a <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/navigational-query\">navigational query</a>. (For example, “how to exit vim stack overflow” will take you to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-vim\">this question</a>, viewed 2.7 million times and counting.) Often, developers return to the same question or answer regularly. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/06/22/asked-and-answered-the-results-for-the-2022-developer-survey-are-here/\">More than 60%</a> of regular Stack Overflow users visit the same question more than once in a three-month period—so if you’re thinking, “Didn’t I <em>just </em>look this up?”, the answer is probably yes. </p>\n<p>These findings reveal how many developers rely on our public platform to serve a second-brain function. Most developers are inundated with information: languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools with their own use cases, shortcuts, workarounds, and optimizations. Second brains tailored for developers’ needs help us capture, organize, and surface knowledge, reducing cognitive load while realizing more value from the knowledge we’re exposed to.</p>\n<p>Other second-brain tools developers favor include <a href=\"https://www.notionsecondbrain.com/\">Notion</a> (whose digital system is actually called Second Brain), <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> (which bills itself as a personal second brain), <a href=\"https://evernote.com/\">Evernote</a>, and <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam</a>, just to name a few.</p>\n<h2><span>What does our reliance on second brains reveal about how we think and work?</span></h2>\n<p>Knowing that so many of us rely on second brains, we wondered what this dependence could tell us about human memory and cognition, especially when it comes to developers and how they work. </p>\n<h3><span>We need help accessing knowledge and memories over time</span></h3>\n<p>In his 2001 book <em>The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers</em>, Harvard researcher Daniel Schacter defines seven “sins of memory,” including transience and absentmindedness, the two failings most relevant to us here. </p>\n<p>Transience refers to memories that simply don’t stick in our minds, or “the decreasing accessibility of memory over time,” according to the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/sins\">American Psychological Association</a>. This usually involves new information that you’re trying to remember, from an unfamiliar function to the name of that person you were just introduced to.</p>\n<p>Absentmindedness refers to “lapses of attention and forgetting to do things,” per the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/sins\">APA</a>. “This sin operates both when a memory is formed (the encoding stage) and when a memory is accessed (the retrieval stage).” Classic examples of absentmindedness: forgetting where you left your phone, accidentally throwing away <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/13/half-a-billion-in-bitcoin-lost-in-the-dump\">half a billion in Bitcoin</a>, or leaving your <a href=\"https://www.classicfm.com/artists/yo-yo-ma/stradivarius-cello-left-in-new-york-taxi/\">$3.5 million cello</a> in the back of a cab.</p>\n<p>A second brain helps us overcome transience and absentmindedness by allowing us to categorize, search, and retrieve information and experiences. Ideally, a second brain empowers you to work “more effectively in the moment,” <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-7-benefits-of-building-a-second-brain/\">writes</a> Tiago Forte: “You can spin up and complete your projects far faster because you’re starting with a collection of valuable material and reusing work you’ve already performed instead of a blank page.”</p>\n<h3><span>We’re overloaded with information…</span></h3>\n<p>As we’ve <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/19/searching-for-answers-and-finding-purple-links-youre-not-alone/\">previously covered</a>, there’s <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/psychology/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/attention-and-memory\">a strong correlation</a> between how much attention we give something and our ability to remember it later. Both transience and absentmindedness are exacerbated when we’re unable to focus, and chronic multitasking can cause us to perform worse on simple memory and cognition tests, according to <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2018/10/25/decade-data-reveals-heavy-multitaskers-reduced-memory-psychologist-says/\">a study</a> from the Stanford Memory Laboratory. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3656338/\">Things get even harder</a> for people experiencing significant stress and anxiety at work, whether those feelings stem from clinical anxiety or a professional culture of looming deadlines, unsupportive managers, and unrealistic expectations. </p>\n<p>Most developers encounter constant, overlapping distractions: pings from chat and email programs, urgent tickets, the need to write code while joining calls and preparing for other meetings. In such a noisy environment, it’s no wonder that things slip your mind. Information overload leads to information exhaustion: We’re exposed to so much information every day that we simply can’t absorb and remember it all without an assist from technology. If you’ll pardon the plug, this is why companies like <a href=\"https://resources.stackoverflow.co/topic/client-stories/microsoft-case-study/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://resources.stackoverflow.co/topic/client-stories/dropbox-case-study/\">Dropbox</a>, and <a href=\"https://resources.stackoverflow.co/topic/client-stories/elastic-case-study\">Elastic</a> use <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.co/teams/\">Stack Overflow for Teams</a> as an organization-wide second brain, to ease the cognitive burden of constant context-switching and to manage collective knowledge.</p>\n<h3><span>…but we don’t want to miss anything</span></h3>\n<p>While most of us are all-too-aware of our information exhaustion, it’s still a priority for us to absorb and retain as much information as possible, especially as we move from project to project or job to job. But that’s much easier said than done. Developers face a proliferation of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools, all of which have various, sometimes-overlapping applications, best practices, common pitfalls, and so on. No wonder some feel there’s simply <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/uud5dm/too_much_to_learn_web_development_sde/\">too much to learn</a>.</p>\n<p>A second brain allows us to reduce noise and manage information overload without worrying that scraps of invaluable knowledge will slip through the cracks while we have 800 different mental tabs open. “By outsourcing the job of remembering to an external tool,” <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-7-benefits-of-building-a-second-brain/\">writes</a> Forte, “we gain the peace of mind of knowing exactly what to do with each piece of incoming information and the confidence that it will never be forgotten.”</p>\n<p>Matt Kiernander <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mpBC83l1dY\">points out</a> that a second brain is enormously helpful for retaining the knowledge you’ll need for repeatable tasks. If, like Matt, you find yourself Googling how to set up PATH variables for your command line every time you set up a new environment, or trying to remember the predefined list of tools and npm packages you need to install, offloading that information to a second brain could save you hours of time and didn’t-I-used-to-know-this frustration.</p>\n<p>Second brains also allow you to make the knowledge you acquire as you move between jobs and projects portable, so that you can bring information like useful code snippets with you on your professional journey. The same goes for using your second brain to document the educational resources you encounter as you learn different technologies, languages, and systems.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://resources.stackoverflow.co/topic/thought-leadership/prioritize-learning/\">best developers</a> are <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/great-developers-never-stop-learning-77b9ce867eac\">constantly learning</a>: reskilling and upskilling, mastering new systems, adding additional languages and technologies to their repertoires. Instead of information going in one ear and out the other, a second brain “helps you take control of your own learning,” <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-7-benefits-of-building-a-second-brain/\">says</a> Forte, curating your learnings in a searchable format you can return to anytime you need to.  </p>\n<h2><span>Innovation is rooted in knowledge</span></h2>\n<p>When you can access information from your personal knowledge store when you need it, you can apply that wealth of experience to new skills and new projects. The idea is to surround yourself with context-rich associations and priceless nuggets of insight and problem-solving that you’ve collected and stored over time—the contents of your mind palace. The value of a second brain goes way beyond reminding you (once again) how to exit Vim or how much brown sugar your favorite cookies call for.

Like: Why do our brains work the way they do?\nTwo years ago, we asked how you feel when you search for an answer and find a purple link—that is, a previously-clicked one. Fifty-two percent of you described your reaction as “Hello, old friend”: meaning you’ve searched for and located this information before. Maybe you’re trying to remember how to exit Vim (again), or maybe you just need to grab a specific regex. Either way, that purple link is reassuring—and, perhaps, exactly what you were looking for.\nWith more than half of developers greeting purple links like old friends (and another 16% reacting with amusement), it was apparent that people were visiting the same questions repeatedly. In fact, we found that 62% of Stack Overflow’s regular users visited the same question more than once in a three-month span. \nClearly, many of us are eager to outsource the work of information recall by treating external information repositories (especially those rich in user-generated content, such as Stack Overflow and Reddit) as second brains: personal knowledge management systems supported by technology.\nThis got us thinking: Is this an effective use of brainpower? Does the space we free up by deploying a second brain get used productively for something else? Or is relying on a second brain a lazy habit that leaves us less knowledgeable, capable of making fewer connections?\nWhen I was doing my doctoral work in English and new media studies, I had a tendency to use Wikipedia to keep track of high-level definitions and straightforward details, like when a book was published or when a historical event happened. The definition of “epistemology” stubbornly refused to stick in my head, as did the year Ray Bradbury first published “A Sound of Thunder,” so I found myself searching for this information once a week or so, clicking that friendly purple link every time.\nAnother example: I’ve been making the same oatmeal cookie recipe for years, but I have yet to memorize it; I just Google it whenever I have a craving. Effectively, I rely on the search bar and the purple link to remember the recipe for me.\nWhy is it easier or more expedient to call up the same information over and over again, rather than committing it to memory? What does our dependence on second brains tell us about the way we learn and work? And for developers, who are constantly deluged with new and complex information, how can the right second brain help your original brain work better?\nWhat is a second brain?\nA second brain is a personal knowledge management system, especially one enabled by technology. The term is often credited to thought leader and author Tiago Forte, whose Building a Second Brain course has done a lot to popularize the concept. (These illustrated notes do a great job of summarizing the course material.) More specifically…\nA second brain is a way of capturing and organizing information to realize its value\nA second brain helps you get a handle on the volume and complexity of information you’re exposed to at virtually all times, with the eventual goal of translating that knowledge into something useful. This is especially critical for developers and other people whose work involves constant exposure to an ever-expanding pool of complex, technical information. Without help from the structures and technologies that comprise a second brain, you can’t absorb or remember the information you’re immersed in, much less call up that information when you might need it to solve a future problem or kick off a new project.\n\nOne simply siphons the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure.\nAlbus Dumbledore\n\n\n\nHarshLight from San Jose, CA, USA, CC BY 2.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0, via Wikimedia Commons\nIn the Harry Potter series, Dumbledore’s Pensieve serves a second-brain function, storing disconnected thoughts and memories and shaping them into coherent patterns to inform actions and decisions. “One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure,” explains Dumbledore. “It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form.”\nA second brain reduces cognitive load by doing your thinking and remembering for you\nThink of a second brain as an extension of your mind: somewhere you can offload cognitive work so you don’t have to struggle to remember information or put it to good use. Like Sherlock Holmes’s mind palace, a second brain is a system for collecting, storing, and curating the tide of information that continually washes over us. “It’s a way of ensuring that the ludicrous amount of information we have to deal with day-to-day stops bouncing around our heads and is recorded somewhere where we can make sense of it in the long term,” explains Stack Overflow developer advocate and evangelist Matt Kiernander. \nA second brain is built on digital technology\nIt’s certainly possible to cobble together a second brain using manual methods, from a notebook to a filing cabinet to a wall plastered with sticky notes. In college, I took notes in the margins of secondhand books as I read, blithely assuming I would remember what my scribbled abbreviations meant (spoiler: I would not, nor would the bookstore buy back any of my books).\nNone of these analog methods is scalable, portable, searchable, or capable of handling data in any format—all essential qualities in the kind of second brain you need. Unless you have access to a Pensieve, I suppose, a digital second brain is far and away the best and most natural choice for most of us who sit in front of computers all day. Your second brain must be: \n\nScalable, so you can capture and preserve a virtually unlimited amount of information.\n\nCapable of storing and organizing data in various formats, from images to videos to chunks of code.\n\nPortable, to permit quick capture and editing of information.\n\nSearchable, so you can easily pull up the knowledge you need when you need it.\nWhat platforms are developers using as their second brains?\nWe’re awfully proud of the fact that 90% of developers turn to Stack Overflow when they get stuck, often via a navigational query. (For example, “how to exit vim stack overflow” will take you to this question, viewed 2.7 million times and counting.) Often, developers return to the same question or answer regularly. More than 60% of regular Stack Overflow users visit the same question more than once in a three-month period—so if you’re thinking, “Didn’t I just look this up?”, the answer is probably yes. \nThese findings reveal how many developers rely on our public platform to serve a second-brain function. Most developers are inundated with information: languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools with their own use cases, shortcuts, workarounds, and optimizations. Second brains tailored for developers’ needs help us capture, organize, and surface knowledge, reducing cognitive load while realizing more value from the knowledge we’re exposed to.\nOther second-brain tools developers favor include Notion (whose digital system is actually called Second Brain), Obsidian (which bills itself as a personal second brain), Evernote, and Roam, just to name a few.\nWhat does our reliance on second brains reveal about how we think and work?\nKnowing that so many of us rely on second brains, we wondered what this dependence could tell us about human memory and cognition, especially when it comes to developers and how they work. \nWe need help accessing knowledge and memories over time\nIn his 2001 book The Seven Sins of Memory: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers, Harvard researcher Daniel Schacter defines seven “sins of memory,” including transience and absentmindedness, the two failings most relevant to us here. \nTransience refers to memories that simply don’t stick in our minds, or “the decreasing accessibility of memory over time,” according to the American Psychological Association. This usually involves new information that you’re trying to remember, from an unfamiliar function to the name of that person you were just introduced to.\nAbsentmindedness refers to “lapses of attention and forgetting to do things,” per the APA. “This sin operates both when a memory is formed (the encoding stage) and when a memory is accessed (the retrieval stage).” Classic examples of absentmindedness: forgetting where you left your phone, accidentally throwing away half a billion in Bitcoin, or leaving your $3.5 million cello in the back of a cab.\nA second brain helps us overcome transience and absentmindedness by allowing us to categorize, search, and retrieve information and experiences. Ideally, a second brain empowers you to work “more effectively in the moment,” writes Tiago Forte: “You can spin up and complete your projects far faster because you’re starting with a collection of valuable material and reusing work you’ve already performed instead of a blank page.”\nWe’re overloaded with information…\nAs we’ve previously covered, there’s a strong correlation between how much attention we give something and our ability to remember it later. Both transience and absentmindedness are exacerbated when we’re unable to focus, and chronic multitasking can cause us to perform worse on simple memory and cognition tests, according to a study from the Stanford Memory Laboratory. Things get even harder for people experiencing significant stress and anxiety at work, whether those feelings stem from clinical anxiety or a professional culture of looming deadlines, unsupportive managers, and unrealistic expectations. \nMost developers encounter constant, overlapping distractions: pings from chat and email programs, urgent tickets, the need to write code while joining calls and preparing for other meetings. In such a noisy environment, it’s no wonder that things slip your mind. Information overload leads to information exhaustion: We’re exposed to so much information every day that we simply can’t absorb and remember it all without an assist from technology. If you’ll pardon the plug, this is why companies like Microsoft, Dropbox, and Elastic use Stack Overflow for Teams as an organization-wide second brain, to ease the cognitive burden of constant context-switching and to manage collective knowledge.\n…but we don’t want to miss anything\nWhile most of us are all-too-aware of our information exhaustion, it’s still a priority for us to absorb and retain as much information as possible, especially as we move from project to project or job to job. But that’s much easier said than done. Developers face a proliferation of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools, all of which have various, sometimes-overlapping applications, best practices, common pitfalls, and so on. No wonder some feel there’s simply too much to learn.\nA second brain allows us to reduce noise and manage information overload without worrying that scraps of invaluable knowledge will slip through the cracks while we have 800 different mental tabs open. “By outsourcing the job of remembering to an external tool,” writes Forte, “we gain the peace of mind of knowing exactly what to do with each piece of incoming information and the confidence that it will never be forgotten.”\nMatt Kiernander points out that a second brain is enormously helpful for retaining the knowledge you’ll need for repeatable tasks. If, like Matt, you find yourself Googling how to set up PATH variables for your command line every time you set up a new environment, or trying to remember the predefined list of tools and npm packages you need to install, offloading that information to a second brain could save you hours of time and didn’t-I-used-to-know-this frustration.\nSecond brains also allow you to make the knowledge you acquire as you move between jobs and projects portable, so that you can bring information like useful code snippets with you on your professional journey. The same goes for using your second brain to document the educational resources you encounter as you learn different technologies, languages, and systems.\nThe best developers are constantly learning: reskilling and upskilling, mastering new systems, adding additional languages and technologies to their repertoires. Instead of information going in one ear and out the other, a second brain “helps you take control of your own learning,” says Forte, curating your learnings in a searchable format you can return to anytime you need to.  \nInnovation is rooted in knowledge\nWhen you can access information from your personal knowledge store when you need it, you can apply that wealth of experience to new skills and new projects. The idea is to surround yourself with context-rich associations and priceless nuggets of insight and problem-solving that you’ve collected and stored over time—the contents of your mind palace. The value of a second brain goes way beyond reminding you (once again) how to exit Vim or how much brown sugar your favorite cookies call for. It’s about making your learnings, insights, and experiences accessible and actionable as you navigate your professional journey.\nThe post Two heads are better than one: What second brains say about how developers work appeared first on Stack Overflow Blog.\n\n\nShare this:\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nTumblr\nPinterest\nMore\n\nPrint\nPocket\n\nTelegram\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nRelated"

        "text": "Every day, I share on Twitter and LinkedIn a list of curated articles I read, resources and tools about UX Design, User Research, UI and mobile design, HTML, CSS, the web industry, some process, some inspiration, etc. This is an archive of everything I shared this week.\n#Now – what I’m up to\nThis week I talked about documenting accessibility for designers. at id24 conference. The video will be online soon, meanwhile, check my version of the talk and the slides.\nAlso, the Stephania is really growing. I’m super happy. She now has small leaves. I just hope the stem won’t break when those leaves will grow.\nWhat’s your favorite way or follow-up sentence to encourage people to go a little bit further in interviews (or tests)? For me it’s a gentle “anything else?” + silence. The silence it important. Let people the time to reflect. It’s ackward, true, but worth it.\nTL;DNR the one you should not miss\n#Semantic HTML\nLink or Button? Use an anchor element (link) when you need to connect two sources, use a button element when you need to let user perform a programmable action (like submitting a form, opening a dialog). As simple as that! by Ashlee M Boyer\nInteresting article\n#Accessibility\nHere’s the Too Long Didn’t Read of all the new things coming to WCAG 2.2\n\nInteresting article on what the new WCAG 2.2 criteria will mean also for the accessibility of the native mobile apps (on @dequesystems’s blog)\nVery interesting conversation by Marcy Sutton on the minimum 4:5:1 or 3:1 for button elements in interfaces, related also to their font-size.\n#User Interviews\nA nice little guide to User Interviews, from what those are, when you need them to planning, writing the guide, recruiting, moderation and analysis by @userinterviews\n\n(inception much hehe?)\n#Product Design\nSmall interesting toughs on Feature Creep. It’ easy to add features to a product, but at some point, you must be smart and also know when to clean the slate. This is why measuring after a feature was launched is really important!\n#Simplicity\nIn case you wonder why the design of Craiglist hasn’t changed much in the last 25 years, here’s an interview from his founder\nInspiration, fun experiments and great ideas\n#Typography\nNeed a nice font, with extra wonk? Why don’t you try Fraunces. It comes with roman and italic styles, and it’s a very nice variable font with a wonk axis!\n#Fun\nLet’s face it: we all design for the best case scenario, especially when it’s print design and advertisement. And them, things get messy. Meet fockups: a place to find mockups to display your designs in bad but realistic conditions.\n#GenerativeArt\nRemember Spirographs? Meet Rotae, a generative art collection based on the vast array of beautiful shapes that can appear from the seemingly simple process of letting circles rotate on (many more) circles\n#Music\nI love a good creative use of the web, so here we go: Music Theory Cheat Sheet: Keys, Scales, Chords, Notes & Intervals\n#Privacy #SocialMedia\nInteresting and quite scary project: @driesdepoorter used open cameras and AI to find how some Instagram photos were taken\nUseful tools and resources that will make your life easy\n#Patterns\nAn interesting catalogue of design patterns gathered from the observations and research of Maggie Appleton.

How about building a lego powered submarine?\nNews in the industry\n#Emojis\nSo, YES finally proper pink heart emoji, because this one was not playing nicely with the other hearts 💗.\n#Figma\n“Adobe acquires Figma, cue the memes“, yup, I’m here for the memes too.

        "html": "<p>The best change I’ve made to my life this year – and maybe in the past 10 years – is creating my own ‘Second Brain’. The Second Brain is an idea popularised by productivity guru <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/\">Tiago Forte</a>, and is a system for personal knowledge management that exists outside of your own head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its most basic, it just means taking digital notes on things. But at its best, it can help you remember everything you ever learn, and use that knowledge to transform your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason to build a system of digital notes is that we all consume tonnes of information, but don’t make the most of it. Many of us spend hours each week watching, listening and reading informational content, but how much of that do we actually absorb? If we spent just a few minutes making notes for every hour we consume content, we’d take in much more – and get much smarter in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A Second Brain is unlimited</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our brains can only store a handful of ideas at any one time. But using technology, we can keep all the advice, insights, and inspiration we’ve collected. It’s like building an extension to your own memory. Not only does it mean you keep the wisdom you’ve accumulated over time, but it frees up your own brain for having ideas, rather than storing them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forte has a whole <a href=\"https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/\">course</a> (starting at $1500!) on how to build your own Second Brain, but here I will distil the key elements so you can start to build your own for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For full disclosure, I haven’t yet taken the Second Brain course (the price tag is a little off-putting), but I’ve consumed tonnes of material elsewhere<span></span><span><a href=\"https://effectiveliving.co/the-basics-of-a-second-brain/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-718\" title=\". Forte himself admits that most of the course material is available online for free. The advantage of the course is doing it with a cohort and being able to get feedback from coaches.\">1</a></span>. I’ve also been working with my own Second Brain for six months. I’m already seeing huge value from it, and want to share that value with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The four key elements of your Second Brain</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Capture</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are whole communities of people dedicated to finding the best way to set up a Second Brain, but it doesn’t need to be complicated. The most fundamental part is ‘Capture’. This just means having a system for making notes, wherever you consume content. If you at least do this step, you’ll probably be getting more value from the content you consume than 80% of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important thing to remember with Capture is that you need to make your notes understandable to your future self. You might only come back to that note in a year’s time, and if it doesn’t make sense to you then, you’ve lost that knowledge. So you need to add a bit of context that will make the note make sense, as well as linking to the original source where possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a> for my digital notes, but there are tonnes of other apps, including Evernote, Roam, OneNote and Apple Notes. Choosing an app can be difficult, as there are lots of factors to consider, but it’s important to remember that the one you choose now doesn’t have to be the one you use forever. I recently imported my Evernotes into Notion, and the software did it for me in minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still make some notes in other programmes, such as on my Kindle, on my laptop hard drive, and in my <a href=\"https://effectiveliving.co/how-read-it-later-apps-help-you-consume-better-content/\">Read It Later app</a>. Ultimately these all end up in Notion, so that I only have to search in one place when I want to find something. There are ways of automating the transfer of these notes to speed up the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Organise</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve got a load of notes, you need some sort of system for organising them. But the great benefit of digital notes is that you can text search them. So organising isn’t that important – and spending too much time on it is counter-productive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forte teaches the <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/\">PARA</a> system of organisation, and I can’t find fault with it. You have only four top level folders: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. You can have sub-folders, but at its most basic, all your notes go into one of those four. I’ve previously written about how freeing it is to have an <a href=\"https://effectiveliving.co/how-to-use-the-archive-folder/\">archive folder</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Projects v Areas v Resources v Archives</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The somewhat tricky bit is deciding what is a project versus an area, versus a resource. Forte’s definitions are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Project – a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Area – a sphere of activity with a standard to </strong><strong>be maintained</strong><strong> over time</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Resource – a topic or theme of ongoing interest</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Archive – inactive items from the other three categories</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some examples, my own projects include writing this article, and the plans for three months of travel I’m about to start. My areas include ‘Finances’, ‘Health &amp; Fitness’, and ‘Social Life’. Resources include ‘Philosophy’ and ‘Habit Formation’ and ‘TV shows to watch’. These topics often have many notes within them, and grow over time, but others consist of a single note. There are no hard and fast rules – it’s about what works for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A notes app that lets you create links between your notes, and which then show those links on the second note (known as bi-directional linking) is helpful for organising. This feature – which is available in Notion and Roam – mirrors how the brain works. It’s great for using the notes to create things like articles, but also helps with your own comprehension.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Distil</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Distilling your notes means reducing them to the key elements. This helps in two ways: the act of distilling your notes enhances your comprehension of the material; and it improves the resource for when you need to quickly re-read and understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mindlessly copying bits of reading material, or making tonnes of notes won’t make you understand that information. And if you have to search through thousands of words to get the gist of a note, that’s much less valuable than being able to glance at a few bullet points. Going through the distillation process increases the value of your notes many times over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forte has a technique for distilling notes called <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/\">Progressive Summarisation</a>. It basically means going through and <strong>bolding</strong> interesting things. You then go through again and <strong><span>highlight the best of the bolded bits</span></strong>. Finally you make a few summary notes – in your own words – at the top of the note. Simple, yet effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Express</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This step’s optional, but it helps your understanding if you turn your notes into something of your own. That could be an article like this one, a podcast, a drawing, or just having a conversation with someone about the topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea behind this step is that it forces you into using a version of <a href=\"https://fs.blog/2021/02/feynman-learning-technique/\">The Feynman Technique</a> for learning. The best way to know if you’ve understood a topic is to try to teach it to someone else. And if it doesn’t make sense to that other person, you can improve on it till it does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This step is the very essence of creativity. No one ever comes up with something completely from scratch, but we recycle and remix others’ ideas into something new<span></span><span><a href=\"https://effectiveliving.co/the-basics-of-a-second-brain/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-718\" title=\"Giving proper credit where it&amp;#8217;s due, of course.\">2</a></span>. Of course, you get bonus points if you integrate concepts from other notes. The combination of multiple ideas is what we call originality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll be writing a lot more on the details of how to build your Second Brain, as it’s such an important topic. I also recommend you check out Tiago Forte’s <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/basbpodcast/\">Building A Second Brain podcast</a>, which you can access through the usual podcast apps. There’s also a <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/basb\">wonderful visualisation</a> of the key elements of building a Second Brain on the <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/\">Maggie Appleton blog</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you only take away one thing from this article, <strong>start collecting digital notes on things now</strong>.

      "content": {
        "html": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/assumed-audience\">Assumed Audience</a>:</strong> The audience for this piece is one that enjoys reading exploratory thinking-out-loud. They have an interest in history and what, if anything, can be learned from specific moments in history.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20220223-how-the-first-ever-pop-star-blazed-a-trail-of-innovation\">this article</a> on the first-ever pop star Charles Dibdin, it’s noted that despite his overwhelming popularity, he began to fade from public memory around 80 years after his death.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“For a whole generation after his death, Dibdin was really current, a lot of his songs were known,” points out Chandler – as we now see with the most popular music of the 20th Century. “There was about 60 years where a lot of English people would have known a number of Dibdin songs. But by the time you get to 80 years after his death, he’s fading. So much new stuff comes along, some of the old just has to get displaced.”</p>\n\n  <p>Whether such a fate awaits pop stars in an era of Spotify remains to be seen. But as Dibdin proves, fame can be a fickle mistress – and there’s no guarantee that being the most popular figure in one era means you’ll be remembered in another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s an interesting idea: that an person’s public memory is maintained only so long as people alive remember them. At 80 years after death most people who ever intersected with Dibdin’s living years would have passed. And it raises a question of:</p>\n<ul><li>how true is it over time?</li>\n  <li>how true is it with ideas as opposed to just people?</li>\n</ul><p>The question of <strong>Does this hold true over time?</strong> comes down to the advent of recorded music and even beyond that: streaming, torrents, CDs, and mp3 files. Dibdin rose to fame in part by selling his sheet music: a way to get his work into as many households, taverns, libraries, etc that he could. While we no longer have his full works (which is concerning given the proliferation of it), we do still have some of his sheet music. By comparison, today your media is shareable by default. And the Library of Congress preserves as much as they can. Will people still listen to the Beatles in 50 years? At least if they want to, they’re likely to have recordings of it. Will that elongate the life of these artists, or does taste change so significantly over time that it doesn’t matter? No song in the <a href=\"https://playback.fm/charts/top-100-songs/1900\">1900s top charts</a> will feel like a bop today.</p>\n\n<p>The second question is: <strong>are ideas <em>also</em> most strongly held in the 80 years after a collective experience?</strong> Take the reconsideration of communism among the American public. When did the American public last have a collective conversation about communism? 60-70 years ago?

        "text": "Assumed Audience: The audience for this piece is one that enjoys reading exploratory thinking-out-loud. They have an interest in history and what, if anything, can be learned from specific moments in history.\n\nIn this article on the first-ever pop star Charles Dibdin, it’s noted that despite his overwhelming popularity, he began to fade from public memory around 80 years after his death.\n\n\n  “For a whole generation after his death, Dibdin was really current, a lot of his songs were known,” points out Chandler – as we now see with the most popular music of the 20th Century. “There was about 60 years where a lot of English people would have known a number of Dibdin songs. But by the time you get to 80 years after his death, he’s fading. So much new stuff comes along, some of the old just has to get displaced.”\n\n  Whether such a fate awaits pop stars in an era of Spotify remains to be seen. But as Dibdin proves, fame can be a fickle mistress – and there’s no guarantee that being the most popular figure in one era means you’ll be remembered in another.\n\n\nIt’s an interesting idea: that an person’s public memory is maintained only so long as people alive remember them. At 80 years after death most people who ever intersected with Dibdin’s living years would have passed. And it raises a question of:\nhow true is it over time?\n  how true is it with ideas as opposed to just people?\nThe question of Does this hold true over time? comes down to the advent of recorded music and even beyond that: streaming, torrents, CDs, and mp3 files. Dibdin rose to fame in part by selling his sheet music: a way to get his work into as many households, taverns, libraries, etc that he could. While we no longer have his full works (which is concerning given the proliferation of it), we do still have some of his sheet music. By comparison, today your media is shareable by default. And the Library of Congress preserves as much as they can. Will people still listen to the Beatles in 50 years? At least if they want to, they’re likely to have recordings of it. Will that elongate the life of these artists, or does taste change so significantly over time that it doesn’t matter? No song in the 1900s top charts will feel like a bop today.\n\nThe second question is: are ideas also most strongly held in the 80 years after a collective experience? Take the reconsideration of communism among the American public. When did the American public last have a collective conversation about communism? 60-70 years ago? We often say history rhymes, is it because we must reassess the previous generation’s conclusions for ourselves?\n\nIt’s a nebulous idea because it’s hard to prove: there are many different pieces here. Holocaust denial having a resurgence almost 80 years after the Holocaust could be related to this idea. Or we could be more susceptible to conspiracy theories due to the way we use social media to mirror our ideas back to us. There’s no end to denial-based conspiracy theories from all eras (moon landing, Sandy Hook, etc).\n\nThe 80 year boundary could also only really apply to people. Ideas are completely different from people and there are ideas that have thrived in support well past the 80 year boundary (e.g. Democracy). Every generation can have an equally real interaction with an idea. I can have a relationship with Democracy that is just as deep as my great great grandparents.

I cannot have the same relationship with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, for example, as people who walked with him in Selma. I instead have a relationship with his memory, ideas and narratives.\n\nIn the end, this 80 year mark in the life of Charles Dibdin may have importance only in the life of Charles Dibdin. But there must be a relationship between the human lifespan of roughly 80 years and 80 years marking the decline of Dibdin’s cultural prominence. It’s too neat for pure coincidence, I think.\n\nInfo:\n\nInspired by: How the first ever pop star blazed a trail of innovation\n\n  \nRelated to:\n    [[🗨️ Grief was what you owed the dead for the necessary crime of living on without them]]\n    \nDid you comment on this?

        "html": "This content is 1 year old. Remember that the following content might be outdated.<p>This article is a bit tricky, yet is going to be super useful to anyone with a blog. Or anyone using images in their communication, conference slides, etc. It will help you if you ever find yourself facing stuff like this: “<em>Ugh, I am so tired of seeing the same boring stock photos on every blog…but then…every visual I pick is also the same exact type of thing that I am tired of seeing. Maybe, if I take this and just move on pixel to the left, people won’t be able to tell I stole the design, branding, visual style?</em>”. Yes, we can tell. </p>\n<p>From <strong>photos</strong>, to <strong>illustrations</strong>, <strong>mosaics</strong> and <strong>abstract patterns</strong>: how could you make your blog headers, images and other visual content part of your brand identity? Here’s some <strong>real world advice</strong> from an experienced designer on how to be your best visual self online, with actual examples.</p>\n<h2>Rethinking the classic “let’s use a stock photo”</h2>\n<p>Let’s start with the basics. You could use images, as in “a stock photos” to illustrate your articles. I’m talking about the “blog header image” here. But this also applies if you want images inside the article. Usually as decoration or “breathing” areas.</p>\n<p>Almost all the blogs (mine included) use that technique. You can use:</p>\n<ul><li>use photos on the topic of the article: simple, efficient</li>\n<li>mix the image(s) with some text overlay something like <a href=\"https://www.webdesignertrends.com/2020/12/ui-ux-incontournables-webdesign-inspi/\">Webdesigner Trends</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>You can create those overlays in design tools. If you do so and have text in your images, don’t forget about alternative attributes on the image if the title is not in the HTML elsewhere. Because, accessibility. You can also achieve<a href=\"https://ishadeed.com/article/handling-text-over-image-css/\"> the overlays with pure CSS</a>. There’s nice techniques in this article “<a href=\"https://www.canva.com/learn/transparent-background/\">How to effectively use transparent backgrounds in graphic design</a>” if you want to start playing with image overlays and transparency. Again, be careful about accessibility though!! You need your text to have enough contrast ratio to read it on top of images.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stock-photos-galleries.jpg\" alt=\"mosaic of different stock photo galleries\" width=\"1200\" height=\"480\" />\n\n<h3>Some places to find nice images</h3>\n<p>Finding the right image is always tricky. How And at some point, everyone ends up with the same boring stock photos. So here are a few place to find nice images, that hopefully go beyond what you see everywhere.</p>\n<ul><li>Let’s start with the classic: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\"><strong>unsplash.com</strong></a>. One thing I like about unsplash is the <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/unporn\">unporn</a> series: a nice place to find pictures if you need to write about nsfw topics (like sexual health).</li>\n<li>Another idea if you can’t find images linked to your theme or topic, is to go full <strong>abstract</strong>. Repeating patterns and geometric images work nicely, and <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/geometric-pattern\">there’s a lot on unsplash</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://nappy.co/\"><strong>Nappy.co</strong></a> provides, I quote, “beautiful photos of Black and Brown people”, for free.</li>\n<li>Diversity in skin tones and on the gender spectrum is important, but so is <strong>diversity in different body types</strong>, abled and not. <a href=\"https://affecttheverb.com/collection/\">Disabled And Here</a> is a disability-led stock image and interview series celebrating disabled Black, Indigenous, people of color (BIPOC).</li>\n<li>If, like me, you are tired of always seeing the same type of people (cis gender conforming people) in images on blog posts, give <a href=\"https://genderphotos.vice.com/\">The Gender Spectrum Collection: Stock Photos Beyond the Binary</a> a try.</li>\n<li>Life is messy, unfiltered. Polished stock photos are nice, yet, soooo boring. If you are tired of boring perfection, this is <a href=\"https://www.stocksy.com/\">Stocksy.com</a>’s promise: Stock Photos and Footage with <strong>no filler </strong>\n</li>\n<li>Now, if you want to bring it next level and have specific needs, icon8 has this tool called <a href=\"https://icons8.com/photos?ref=stephaniewalter\">Moose</a> and it lets you create your own scenes. <a href=\"https://icons8.com/creator/template/5d0d2773f0fed7001f121007?ref=stephaniewalter\">Need a giant dog in the living room with a guy eating salad? Yup, they got you covered</a>\n</li>\n<li>Also, this <a href=\"https://www.myriamjessier.com/blog/best-list-of-free-stock-photo-images-for-commercial-use/\">list of free stock photo images for commercial use</a> is a nice recap.</li>\n</ul><h2>Spicing up boring stock photos</h2>\n<p></p><img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/images-colors.jpg\" alt=\"Visual examples of the technics described above\" width=\"1200\" height=\"477\" />\n<p>Okay you might say “yes but if everyone is using images, how might I spice things up and make those unique”.</p>\n<p>There’s a few things you could do:</p>\n<ul><li>Have some <strong>colored overlay</strong> on top of your images <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/going-indie-reclaiming-content\">just like Matthias does here</a>. Bonus if it matches your brand identity. You can see  this in action on “<a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/how-can-i-find-my-first-ux-job/\">How can I find my first ux job</a>” and “<a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/80-ux-blogs-with-rss-feed-to-follow/\">80+ UX blogs (with RSS feed) to follow</a>”. I am in both using a stock photo, and applied a purple filter.</li>\n<li>This trick also works with <strong>gradients</strong>. CSS Tricks mixes a lot of different image techniques. But every image has this orange purple blue gradient on top of them to give them some consistency and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/archives/\">make it look nice on the homepage</a>\n</li>\n<li>You could also decide you want them all to be <strong>black and white </strong><a href=\"https://henry.codes/writing\">like Henry Desroches’s website</a>\n</li>\n<li>Or you could do like my friend Myriam: she once decided she would give a talk with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10s5Vz6Y2FoACBds1LtuRnxRA6UnfLhz2LKq_gp1JDm4/edit?usp=sharing\">only pink images</a>. And it was awesome and it worked. The images had little to nothing to do with the talk. But, it worked. Because, there was <strong>consistency</strong> and a theme.</li>\n</ul><h3>Some tools to spice up your photos</h3>\n<p></p><img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/color-image-tools.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of the following tools\" width=\"1080\" height=\"477\" />\n<p>Image editing can be annoying so here are some tools to help:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/\">Dither images</a> could be your thing, there’s plenty of styles to explorer with this tool</li>\n<li>Bring back <a href=\"https://duotones.co/\">duotones images</a> back to something trendy, I dare you</li>\n<li>With <a href=\"https://www.fecolormatrix.com/\">SVG color Matrix Mixer</a> you can generator some SVG <strong>color matrix filters</strong> on top of images. This way, you don’t need design tools to color images but can apply those on your websites.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://yoksel.github.io/svg-gradient-map/#/\">SVG Gradient Map Filter</a>: another tool to build some duotone on top of an image using SVG</li>\n<li>If you are into gradients you could try <a href=\"https://omatsuri.app/gradient-generator\">this</a> or <a href=\"https://omatsuri.app/gradient-generator\">this</a> and add them in CSS with some blend modes on top of your images.

For real. They have been for a while now. They offer <strong>more flexibility</strong> than stock photos because your imagination is the limit. And you can go super abstract.</p>\n<p>Here are some cool examples if you are looking for “how do people use illustrations” inspiration:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://www.viget.com/articles/\">Viget</a> is a good example of simplicity for the usage of illustrations. Each article header is one rounded illustration with a nice colorful background that depends on the category.</li>\n<li>Each article on <a href=\"https://www.cassie.codes/writing/\">Cassie Evan’s blog</a> is represented by a nice little illustration</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.sandrabydesign.com/blog\">Sandra Camacho’s insights</a> use cute branded illustrations in the preview and on the article</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/human-readable-javascript/\">A List Apart</a> brings illustration to the next level, each article has a custom banner illustration. It has been this way for years now and I love it.</li>\n<li>I also love the drawing style of the illustrations on <a href=\"https://sketchplanations.com/archive\">Sketchplanations</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/\">The blog of UX Pin</a> has some simple illustrations, most of the time geometric ones but it works quite well</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://whoisnicoleharris.com/2018/07/26/pypi-past-present-future.html\">Nicole Harris’s</a> <a href=\"https://whoisnicoleharris.com/2016/04/16/djangocon-eu-2016.html\">articles headers</a> <a href=\"https://whoisnicoleharris.com/2015/03/19/bdd-part-two.html\">are all a color</a>, <a href=\"https://whoisnicoleharris.com/2014/12/29/2014-my-year-of-python.html\">a white illustration</a>, <a href=\"https://whoisnicoleharris.com/2018/05/17/warehouse-accessibility.html\">some text,</a> that’s it. And it works nicely</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/essays\">Maggie Appleton</a> uses awesome hand drawn illustrations as images to introduce her essays</li>\n<li>Another trick with images is to have images (or illustrations) on a specific theme, like  <a href=\"https://tympanus.net/codrops/collective/\">Codrops Collective</a> does.</li>\n</ul><p>And the list goes on and on.</p>\n<h3>Getting the most out of illustrations for your blog</h3>\n<p>Here’s a few illustrations tips to bring more consistency to your blog and brand:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/lodge/svg/\"><strong>SVG </strong>for illustrations is awesome</a>. You can embed SVG illustrations directly on websites and it would be lighter than PNGs. The annoying part is that some CMSs like WordPress won’t let you do so by default (but there’s tricks). But if you have a custom blog, it’s worth a shot. You can also embed JavaScript so you animate those. And you can <strong>mix vector and JPG/PNG images in SVG</strong> just like <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/\">Khan Academy homepage</a>. SVG is also an open door to <a href=\"https://pudding.cool/\">awesome interactive infographics</a>.</li>\n<li>Illustration authors usually have a specific “style” (or a few styles). If you need multiple illustrations, <strong>try to use illustrations from the same “pack</strong>”. This will again help bring <strong>consistency</strong>. My trick: check the profile of the authors on the different platforms and cherry pick the illustrations that go well together.</li>\n<li>Illustrations usually come in vector format like SVG, AI (for illustrator) or more versatil EPS. You can open those with vector tools (like <a href=\"https://inkscape.org/\">Inkscape</a> which is free, but also <a href=\"https://vectr.com/\">vectr.com</a> in the browser or even figma). You can <strong>change the colors of the illustrations </strong>to have them <strong>match your brand identity</strong>. Some of the galleries in the next section even come with built in tools to recolor those).</li>\n<li>If you want something specific, <strong>hire a professional illustrator</strong> (reach out in email if you need some names). Usually illustrators take commission and can create you a set of different illustrations on some themes you can reuse</li>\n</ul><p>Of course you don’t have to go one style or another. <strong>Mixing strategies</strong> based on different content types works nicely. For example <a href=\"https://uxmag.com/\">uxmag.com</a> has a mix of sometimes illustrations. So does <a href=\"https://www.thinkcompany.com/blog/\">Think Company</a>, but if you look at their illustrations, you’ll see consistency in the styles.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/illustrations-tools.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshots of illustration galleries\" width=\"1200\" height=\"480\" />\n\n<h4>Recolor Icons and Illustrations in Illustrator</h4>\n<p></p><img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/illustrator-recolorartwork.jpg\" alt=\"Illustrator file opened with the &quot;recolor artwork&quot; example with yellow and purple colors\" width=\"1200\" height=\"521\" />\n<p>So, let’s talk about my <strong>secret weapon for illustrations</strong>. I told you in the introduction, I’m giving you all the secrets so that you can steal like an artist (also yes, check that book). For all my personal projects for example I use the <a href=\"https://streamlineicons.com/\">streamline icons and illustrations</a>. Here’s my pro tip: I use <strong>Illustrator’s “recolor artwork” </strong>tool to quickly recolor them. I can also try out different options and have them match my yellow and purple brand identity. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJRESPUO5zw\">Here’s a video to teach you how to</a>. Another Illustrator tip: if you want to <strong>manually replace colors</strong>, you could use select &gt; same  &gt; color and fill to <strong>select everything that has the same color</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Cool places to find cool illustrations</h3>\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://stubborn.fun/\">Stubborn.fun</a> is a character generator that also lets you create scenes</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://blush.design/\">Blush.design</a> is a figma and sketch plugin to create storytelling illustrations</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://weareskribbl.com/\">Weareskribbl.com</a> is a collection of free hand drawn illustrations in a “black and white line style”</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.drawkit.io/\">Drawkit.io</a> is a collection of nice illustrations updated weekly</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://undraw.co/\">Undraw.co</a> became one of the big classics when it comes to free minimal illustrations</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://freeillustrations.xyz/\">Freeillustrations.xyz</a> offers a lot of illustrations kits in different styles</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.getillustrations.com/\">getillustrations.com</a> is another nice place to find free and non free illustrations</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://icons8.com/illustrations?ref=stephaniewalter\">icon8</a> also has nice illustrations. Bonus point, you can recolor those in their tool directly. Worth a try.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.blackillustrations.com/\">Blackillustrations.com</a> are beautiful illustrations of Black people for your next digital project</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://mixkit.co/free-stock-art/\">Mixkit.co</a> has a lot of free resources (videos, sound) and has a section dedicated to “free stock art”.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/biodivlibrary/albums\">Biodiversity Heritage Library’s albums</a> offer images from old books, plants and animals that I love so much. I admit it’s a specific style. But it can work.</li>\n<li>Another really specific style of images can be found on <a href=\"https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/\">oldbookillustrations.com</a>. I am not sure if this goes under illustrations or images, it’s definitely a really specific style, but I kind of like it. You could have a whole series on animals, people, etc. The cool part: since it’s mostly black and white you can have a lot of fun with filters and recoloring those. This <a href=\"https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/newsletters\">awesome essay on newsletter uses that style</a>, and it works!</li>\n</ul><h2>How to “find” the right images and concepts.</h2>\n<p>Time for another secret trick: when I am looking for images (or illustrations) to illustrate a concept, I <strong>start with a </strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%22user+research%22&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi90L-s-PvvAhWchP0HHUzfAGEQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=%22user+research%22&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BAgAEEM6BAgjECc6BAgAEBg6BggAEAcQHlCgJFicRWCSR2gHcAB4AIABfogBlgqSAQQyMS4xmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=9u51YL39OpyJ9u8PzL6DiAY&amp;bih=1341&amp;biw=1363&amp;client=firefox-b-d\"><strong>Google image search</strong></a>. This gives me a first “trend” of <strong>what other humans expect to “see”</strong> around this topic. Another thing I love with the Google image search results is the suggestions. This helps me understand <strong>taxonomies</strong> and what humans, again, expect around this concept. This is how my SEO friend Myriam explains it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“ Google tries here to make some human/machine translation of a concept into distinct entities, aka, build taxonomies, like, hashtags”.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And this is gold to help you find images. A lot of “image search engines” like <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/ux-design\">unsplash</a> do this trick as well and help you expand your search.</p>\n<p></p><img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/images-tips-research.jpg\" alt=\"Google search results with some taxonomy propositions, same for unsplash with some taxonomy tags\" width=\"1200\" height=\"477\" />\n<p>I also like to take a look at what kind of images come up in <a href=\"https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=UX+design\">The Noun Project</a>. Again, the idea is to understand human mental models to illustrate concepts. Last but no least, you could take a look at “<a href=\"https://same.energy/\">Same Energy</a>”, a visual search engine.</p>\n<h2>Mandatory copyright and license warning</h2>\n<p>TLDNR: check the image/illustration <strong>license</strong>. If there’s no license, <strong>don’t re-use unless you asked for permission</strong>.</p>\n<p>I can’t write an article about images and illustrations without a warning about copyright. I’m honestly quite tired of the design community, but also of other communities giving zero toughs about copyright. So let me put this here: <strong>just because someone put an image or an illustration on a blog, it doesn’t mean you can reuse it</strong>. Especially on commercial content. <em>And yes, I’m pointing at you, agencies who use content from my blog without my permission. I see you 🙂  </em></p>\n<p>So, before using ANY image, photo, illustration: <strong>check the copyright rules</strong>. And, follow those. By default, if there’s no mention or copyright, the image belongs to the blog owner (unless they themselves stole it from somewhere). So, by default, unless it’s written otherwise, you can’t use an image from someone else.</p>\n<p>The good news is that today, there’s a lot of content under <strong>creative common licenses</strong> and open licenses. You can use most of that content, even for commercial use (unless the license says otherwise). But you usually still need to credit the author somewhere.</p>\n<h2>Mosaic, grids and collages of images and photos</h2>\n<p>I’m not going to pretend otherwise: mozaic and collages might be THE technic I use the most for my blog images. Mosaics work really nicely if, like me, you publish posts that are resources or lists of content on different topics. I did (and still do) a lot of tests and explore with the format a lot. Here are a few examples from my own experiments over the last, like, 10 years of blogging. <em>I told you that today, I’m showing you all the tricks in my book 😉</em></p>\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/pixels-week-january-3-2016/\">5 years ago</a> I used to have only 2 images in the collages</li>\n<li>Then, about 3 or 4 years ago, I started to <a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/pixels-of-the-week-june-3-2018/\">use more vertical images in the collage</a>, since a lot of websites are now optimized for responsive web design. I also use this technique when <a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/ux-starter-crash-course-for-startups/\">I have a few nice portrait images.</a>\n</li>\n<li>For the last 6 months, I have been sharing more and more “inspiration” resources. So the vertical mosaic doesn’t always fit. I started adding <a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/pixels-of-the-week-january-31-2021/\">some portrait and landscape images to the mix</a>.</li>\n<li>Did someone say <a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/bibliography-selected-books-about-design-user-experience/\">colorful collage mosaic.</a> Here I explored with even more images, since it’s book covers, and ordered them by color.</li>\n<li>To have something more dynamic, I’m also testing a -12deg angle on the mosaics (why 12deg? Because I like it like that). It started with my conference transcripts where I use <a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/enhancing-user-experience-with-css-animations/\">mosaics of the slides. </a>But I’m also <a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/pixels-of-the-week-aprils-11-2021/\">exploring this format for the weekly links now</a>. I like it because it works with my design and breaks the straight horizontal lines a little bit.</li>\n</ul><p></p><img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mosaic.jpg\" alt=\"A mozaic of mozaics examples\" width=\"1200\" height=\"477\" />\n<p>I’m not sure there’s generators or tools for collages. I do them in Sketch. But still, there’s a few tips and places you could use for inspiration:</p>\n<ul><li>You could explore with <strong>zero gutter</strong> collages (like mine). Or explore some styles with more spacing and <strong>gutter</strong> like <a href=\"https://frontender-ua.medium.com/frontend-weekly-digest-203-22-28-march-2021-89add62c1e10\">Frontend Weekly</a> does. If you go for gutters, which is, the most annoying thing to do, you need to make sure you have proper and <strong>consistent</strong> <strong>spacing everywhere</strong>. This is why I find this annoying to do. My trick here: cut the images if needed.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://blog.prototypr.io/designing-emails-for-unacademy-using-figma-power-of-nocode-eceee9daf5c6\"><strong>Angle mosaics </strong>are trendy</a>, also it works with gutters.</li>\n<li>You could also use some <strong>grids of logos</strong> like <a href=\"https://uxplanet.org/6-ux-design-portfolio-builders-you-should-try-from-low-effort-to-highly-customizable-66316b434f58\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>And <a href=\"https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2021/03/15-useful-tools-resources-worth-checking-out/\">here are even more angled mosaics</a>.</li>\n<li>Like images, you can bring <strong>consistency</strong> by applying a whole <strong>color overlay</strong> if you want. Or have them all black and white. <a href=\"https://tympanus.net/codrops/category/articles/ui-interactions-animations-roundups/\">Codrops is, again, an awesome example of this</a>. Each of their roundups has a color filter which brings consistency to the whole mosaic.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Have grid,</strong> then, break the grid and explore with diagonals and outside the box things. <a href=\"https://designshack.net/articles/graphics/tips-for-designing-with-multiple-photos/\">This is an old article from 2011 I still like on the topic of multiple image layout</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Find inspiration outside of the web</strong>: architecture and print design, magazine layouts are a good start here for that kind of ideas.</li>\n</ul><h2>Abstract art and backgrounds + some text.</h2>\n<p></p><img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/abstract-example-.jpg\" alt=\"Abstract background examples\" width=\"1200\" height=\"477\" />\n<p>It’s sometimes hard and long to find images, photos and illustrations. So, <strong>going abstract</strong> could also be an easy road to go. There’s a lot of generators in the next sections. Going abstract background + some simple text offers a LOT of possibilities while still keeping consistency around all your articles and posts and your brand. Just <a href=\"https://codepen.io/georgedoescode/full/PoGLmmX\">hit refresh on George’s generator here</a> to know what I mean. Endless possibilities with little investment.

Or any decoration images except for when they help explain something. Those kinds of blogs usually rely on a nice layout, elegant typography, and a great use of colors, gradients, borders.

        "text": "This content is 1 year old. Remember that the following content might be outdated.This article is a bit tricky, yet is going to be super useful to anyone with a blog. Or anyone using images in their communication, conference slides, etc. It will help you if you ever find yourself facing stuff like this: “Ugh, I am so tired of seeing the same boring stock photos on every blog…but then…every visual I pick is also the same exact type of thing that I am tired of seeing. Maybe, if I take this and just move on pixel to the left, people won’t be able to tell I stole the design, branding, visual style?”. Yes, we can tell. \nFrom photos, to illustrations, mosaics and abstract patterns: how could you make your blog headers, images and other visual content part of your brand identity? Here’s some real world advice from an experienced designer on how to be your best visual self online, with actual examples.\nRethinking the classic “let’s use a stock photo”\nLet’s start with the basics. You could use images, as in “a stock photos” to illustrate your articles. I’m talking about the “blog header image” here. But this also applies if you want images inside the article. Usually as decoration or “breathing” areas.\nAlmost all the blogs (mine included) use that technique. You can use:\nuse photos on the topic of the article: simple, efficient\nmix the image(s) with some text overlay something like Webdesigner Trends.\nYou can create those overlays in design tools. If you do so and have text in your images, don’t forget about alternative attributes on the image if the title is not in the HTML elsewhere. Because, accessibility. You can also achieve the overlays with pure CSS. There’s nice techniques in this article “How to effectively use transparent backgrounds in graphic design” if you want to start playing with image overlays and transparency. Again, be careful about accessibility though!! You need your text to have enough contrast ratio to read it on top of images.\n\nSome places to find nice images\nFinding the right image is always tricky. How And at some point, everyone ends up with the same boring stock photos. So here are a few place to find nice images, that hopefully go beyond what you see everywhere.\nLet’s start with the classic: unsplash.com. One thing I like about unsplash is the unporn series: a nice place to find pictures if you need to write about nsfw topics (like sexual health).\nAnother idea if you can’t find images linked to your theme or topic, is to go full abstract. Repeating patterns and geometric images work nicely, and there’s a lot on unsplash\n\n\nNappy.co provides, I quote, “beautiful photos of Black and Brown people”, for free.\nDiversity in skin tones and on the gender spectrum is important, but so is diversity in different body types, abled and not. Disabled And Here is a disability-led stock image and interview series celebrating disabled Black, Indigenous, people of color (BIPOC).\nIf, like me, you are tired of always seeing the same type of people (cis gender conforming people) in images on blog posts, give The Gender Spectrum Collection: Stock Photos Beyond the Binary a try.\nLife is messy, unfiltered. Polished stock photos are nice, yet, soooo boring. If you are tired of boring perfection, this is Stocksy.com’s promise: Stock Photos and Footage with no filler \n\nNow, if you want to bring it next level and have specific needs, icon8 has this tool called Moose and it lets you create your own scenes. Need a giant dog in the living room with a guy eating salad? Yup, they got you covered\n\nAlso, this list of free stock photo images for commercial use is a nice recap.\nSpicing up boring stock photos\nOkay you might say “yes but if everyone is using images, how might I spice things up and make those unique”.\nThere’s a few things you could do:\nHave some colored overlay on top of your images just like Matthias does here. Bonus if it matches your brand identity. You can see  this in action on “How can I find my first ux job” and “80+ UX blogs (with RSS feed) to follow”. I am in both using a stock photo, and applied a purple filter.\nThis trick also works with gradients. CSS Tricks mixes a lot of different image techniques. But every image has this orange purple blue gradient on top of them to give them some consistency and make it look nice on the homepage\n\nYou could also decide you want them all to be black and white like Henry Desroches’s website\n\nOr you could do like my friend Myriam: she once decided she would give a talk with only pink images. And it was awesome and it worked. The images had little to nothing to do with the talk. But, it worked. Because, there was consistency and a theme.\nSome tools to spice up your photos\nImage editing can be annoying so here are some tools to help:\n\nDither images could be your thing, there’s plenty of styles to explorer with this tool\nBring back duotones images back to something trendy, I dare you\nWith SVG color Matrix Mixer you can generator some SVG color matrix filters on top of images. This way, you don’t need design tools to color images but can apply those on your websites.\n\nSVG Gradient Map Filter: another tool to build some duotone on top of an image using SVG\nIf you are into gradients you could try this or this and add them in CSS with some blend modes on top of your images. This means you don’t need to edit every single image, let the browser do the job.\nI do most of my editing in Sketch (Photoshop if I really want something fancy) so I don’t have that many online tools. Feel free to reach out by email or twitter if you have some nice gems to share here.\nBringing in some characters and illustrations\nIllustrations are super trendy. For real. They have been for a while now. They offer more flexibility than stock photos because your imagination is the limit. And you can go super abstract.\nHere are some cool examples if you are looking for “how do people use illustrations” inspiration:\n\nViget is a good example of simplicity for the usage of illustrations. Each article header is one rounded illustration with a nice colorful background that depends on the category.\nEach article on Cassie Evan’s blog is represented by a nice little illustration\n\nSandra Camacho’s insights use cute branded illustrations in the preview and on the article\n\nA List Apart brings illustration to the next level, each article has a custom banner illustration. It has been this way for years now and I love it.\nI also love the drawing style of the illustrations on Sketchplanations\n\n\nThe blog of UX Pin has some simple illustrations, most of the time geometric ones but it works quite well\n\nNicole Harris’s articles headers are all a color, a white illustration, some text, that’s it. And it works nicely\n\nMaggie Appleton uses awesome hand drawn illustrations as images to introduce her essays\nAnother trick with images is to have images (or illustrations) on a specific theme, like  Codrops Collective does.\nAnd the list goes on and on.\nGetting the most out of illustrations for your blog\nHere’s a few illustrations tips to bring more consistency to your blog and brand:\n\nSVG for illustrations is awesome. You can embed SVG illustrations directly on websites and it would be lighter than PNGs. The annoying part is that some CMSs like WordPress won’t let you do so by default (but there’s tricks). But if you have a custom blog, it’s worth a shot. You can also embed JavaScript so you animate those. And you can mix vector and JPG/PNG images in SVG just like Khan Academy homepage. SVG is also an open door to awesome interactive infographics.\nIllustration authors usually have a specific “style” (or a few styles). If you need multiple illustrations, try to use illustrations from the same “pack”. This will again help bring consistency. My trick: check the profile of the authors on the different platforms and cherry pick the illustrations that go well together.\nIllustrations usually come in vector format like SVG, AI (for illustrator) or more versatil EPS. You can open those with vector tools (like Inkscape which is free, but also vectr.com in the browser or even figma). You can change the colors of the illustrations to have them match your brand identity. Some of the galleries in the next section even come with built in tools to recolor those).\nIf you want something specific, hire a professional illustrator (reach out in email if you need some names). Usually illustrators take commission and can create you a set of different illustrations on some themes you can reuse\nOf course you don’t have to go one style or another. Mixing strategies based on different content types works nicely. For example uxmag.com has a mix of sometimes illustrations. So does Think Company, but if you look at their illustrations, you’ll see consistency in the styles.\n\nRecolor Icons and Illustrations in Illustrator\nSo, let’s talk about my secret weapon for illustrations. I told you in the introduction, I’m giving you all the secrets so that you can steal like an artist (also yes, check that book). For all my personal projects for example I use the streamline icons and illustrations. Here’s my pro tip: I use Illustrator’s “recolor artwork” tool to quickly recolor them. I can also try out different options and have them match my yellow and purple brand identity. Here’s a video to teach you how to. Another Illustrator tip: if you want to manually replace colors, you could use select > same  > color and fill to select everything that has the same color.\nCool places to find cool illustrations\n\nStubborn.fun is a character generator that also lets you create scenes\n\nBlush.design is a figma and sketch plugin to create storytelling illustrations\n\nWeareskribbl.com is a collection of free hand drawn illustrations in a “black and white line style”\n\nDrawkit.io is a collection of nice illustrations updated weekly\n\nUndraw.co became one of the big classics when it comes to free minimal illustrations\n\nFreeillustrations.xyz offers a lot of illustrations kits in different styles\n\ngetillustrations.com is another nice place to find free and non free illustrations\n\nicon8 also has nice illustrations. Bonus point, you can recolor those in their tool directly. Worth a try.\n\nBlackillustrations.com are beautiful illustrations of Black people for your next digital project\n\nMixkit.co has a lot of free resources (videos, sound) and has a section dedicated to “free stock art”.\n\nBiodiversity Heritage Library’s albums offer images from old books, plants and animals that I love so much. I admit it’s a specific style. But it can work.\nAnother really specific style of images can be found on oldbookillustrations.com. I am not sure if this goes under illustrations or images, it’s definitely a really specific style, but I kind of like it. You could have a whole series on animals, people, etc. The cool part: since it’s mostly black and white you can have a lot of fun with filters and recoloring those. This awesome essay on newsletter uses that style, and it works!\nHow to “find” the right images and concepts.\nTime for another secret trick: when I am looking for images (or illustrations) to illustrate a concept, I start with a Google image search. This gives me a first “trend” of what other humans expect to “see” around this topic. Another thing I love with the Google image search results is the suggestions. This helps me understand taxonomies and what humans, again, expect around this concept. This is how my SEO friend Myriam explains it:\n“ Google tries here to make some human/machine translation of a concept into distinct entities, aka, build taxonomies, like, hashtags”.\nAnd this is gold to help you find images. A lot of “image search engines” like unsplash do this trick as well and help you expand your search.\nI also like to take a look at what kind of images come up in The Noun Project. Again, the idea is to understand human mental models to illustrate concepts. Last but no least, you could take a look at “Same Energy”, a visual search engine.\nMandatory copyright and license warning\nTLDNR: check the image/illustration license. If there’s no license, don’t re-use unless you asked for permission.\nI can’t write an article about images and illustrations without a warning about copyright. I’m honestly quite tired of the design community, but also of other communities giving zero toughs about copyright. So let me put this here: just because someone put an image or an illustration on a blog, it doesn’t mean you can reuse it. Especially on commercial content. And yes, I’m pointing at you, agencies who use content from my blog without my permission. I see you 🙂  \nSo, before using ANY image, photo, illustration: check the copyright rules. And, follow those. By default, if there’s no mention or copyright, the image belongs to the blog owner (unless they themselves stole it from somewhere). So, by default, unless it’s written otherwise, you can’t use an image from someone else.\nThe good news is that today, there’s a lot of content under creative common licenses and open licenses. You can use most of that content, even for commercial use (unless the license says otherwise). But you usually still need to credit the author somewhere.\nMosaic, grids and collages of images and photos\nI’m not going to pretend otherwise: mozaic and collages might be THE technic I use the most for my blog images. Mosaics work really nicely if, like me, you publish posts that are resources or lists of content on different topics. I did (and still do) a lot of tests and explore with the format a lot. Here are a few examples from my own experiments over the last, like, 10 years of blogging. I told you that today, I’m showing you all the tricks in my book 😉\n\n5 years ago I used to have only 2 images in the collages\nThen, about 3 or 4 years ago, I started to use more vertical images in the collage, since a lot of websites are now optimized for responsive web design. I also use this technique when I have a few nice portrait images.\n\nFor the last 6 months, I have been sharing more and more “inspiration” resources. So the vertical mosaic doesn’t always fit. I started adding some portrait and landscape images to the mix.\nDid someone say colorful collage mosaic. Here I explored with even more images, since it’s book covers, and ordered them by color.\nTo have something more dynamic, I’m also testing a -12deg angle on the mosaics (why 12deg? Because I like it like that). It started with my conference transcripts where I use mosaics of the slides. But I’m also exploring this format for the weekly links now. I like it because it works with my design and breaks the straight horizontal lines a little bit.\nI’m not sure there’s generators or tools for collages. I do them in Sketch. But still, there’s a few tips and places you could use for inspiration:\nYou could explore with zero gutter collages (like mine). Or explore some styles with more spacing and gutter like Frontend Weekly does. If you go for gutters, which is, the most annoying thing to do, you need to make sure you have proper and consistent spacing everywhere. This is why I find this annoying to do. My trick here: cut the images if needed.\n\nAngle mosaics are trendy, also it works with gutters.\nYou could also use some grids of logos like here.\nAnd here are even more angled mosaics.\nLike images, you can bring consistency by applying a whole color overlay if you want. Or have them all black and white. Codrops is, again, an awesome example of this. Each of their roundups has a color filter which brings consistency to the whole mosaic.\n\nHave grid, then, break the grid and explore with diagonals and outside the box things. This is an old article from 2011 I still like on the topic of multiple image layout\n\n\nFind inspiration outside of the web: architecture and print design, magazine layouts are a good start here for that kind of ideas.\nAbstract art and backgrounds + some text.\nIt’s sometimes hard and long to find images, photos and illustrations. So, going abstract could also be an easy road to go. There’s a lot of generators in the next sections. Going abstract background + some simple text offers a LOT of possibilities while still keeping consistency around all your articles and posts and your brand. Just hit refresh on George’s generator here to know what I mean. Endless possibilities with little investment. Perfect if you don’t want to spend too much time but still want something nice.\nFor your inspiration, here’s a few examples of that abstract pattern trend.\n\nThis article on UX Planet uses some geometric background and just some text. Easy, effective.\n\nHere you have an example of just some background repeating pattern and some text as well.\nBig blue background, abstracted “f” geometric forms, here we go\n\n\nHere’s an example of a background and just a logo, that does the trick, simple, efficient.\n\nbugsnag.com uses those geometric shapes in their blog headers, it’s beautiful, abstract and it works nicely\nAbstract SVG and patterns generators\nThere’s plenty of places to find some nice abstract patterns. Most of them generate SVG, because it’s THE format that is perfect for that.\n\nHaikei.app is an webapp with 15 abstract SVG generators\n\nTabbied.com is a random geometric doodle shapes generator\nWhat about some springles or colored shapes? Check the rest out on bgjar.com\n\nI like glitchart.io, it can be used to create awesome things\nYou can find some awesome repeating patterns on heropatterns.com, pattern.monster\n\n\nMore polygon patterns in here. Yep, I love polygon patterns, sue me!\nIf you are looking for some cool polygon background and more: coolbackgrounds.io\n\nGenerate a pattern from a SVG you upload on this site and use it as background for text or other articles headings\nAnd another really cool pattern generator here \n\nGenerate patterns from different SVG icons with patternico.com\n\nIf you want a gif of “moving” backgrounds (I don’t think it’s a good idea since it might be annoying though) you could use Loading.io\n\nThis Sketch plugin generates confettis using patterns you created\nNo image, nice layout, beautiful typography, awesome colors\nLast but not least, you could also simply not have any header image. Or any decoration images except for when they help explain something. Those kinds of blogs usually rely on a nice layout, elegant typography, and a great use of colors, gradients, borders. Note that you still might need an image when sharing on social media though.\nHere are a few examples I like:\n\nTatiana Mac has a colorful blog, typography choices are awesome, no image needed.\n\nHugo Kitty Giraudel makes a nice use of gradient, again, no image needed\n\nSarah L. Fossheim has brings some awesome colors and borders\n\nGift Egwuenu has that awesome pink gradient border and the nicest title font face\n\nStephanie Stimac has those really nice purple links list\n\nEthan Marcotte’s blog is another beautiful of awesome typography, delicious subtle backgrounds, nothing more is needed here.\n\nJosh Comeau is also a nice example here if you are looking for simple effective typography\nAnother great one, but I’m biased because I love those Gs is Andy Bell’s Piccalil.li\n\nSo, that’s it. I hope I gave you nice ideas for different visual content and images for you blog posts, but also conference talks. Shoot me an email if you have more ideas or tools to share. Also big thanks to Myriam for helping me with that article 🙂"

a very long time –\nthough the domain and the underlying tech\n(and most of the content)\nhas shifted more than once.\nIs it still the same site,\nif I can just take out all the words,\nand put in new<span> </span>words?</p>\n<p>(<em>yes</em>)</p>\n<p>Over the last several years,\nI’ve leaned –\nor devolved? –\ninto an approach that is not quite\n<a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history\">digital gardening</a>\nbut also not ‘posting’ in a blog format.\nIt’s become almost\na retroactive digital archive of shifting,\ncross-referenced,\nprojects and events.\nA digital timeline\nof what happened along the<span> </span>way.</p>\n<p>(<em>I have found\nthere are sometimes\ngood reasons to\n<a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/link-promise/\">break a promise</a></em>)</p>\n<p>Lately I’ve been\nfeeling the <em>evaporative</em>\nnature of so many art projects.\nI work hard,\nI’m proud of the work,\nbut once it’s done\nit becomes…\none more markdown entry to file away\nwith yaml metadata\nin this digital<span> </span>cabinet.</p>\n<p>A semi-sorted mound of detritus –\nthe results of living,\ntrying things,\nchanging my mind,\nand trying something else.\nA curriculum vitae,\nwith too much color and<span> </span>detail.</p>\n<p>(<em>let me show you the lovely flier\nfrom my latest\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/theater/pity-fear/\">live performance</a>\nand a single line\ndocumenting <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/theater/newworld/danny-deep/lights/\">my first one</a></em>)</p>\n<p>That feeling has bled into\nmy relationship with social media.\nI have a thought.\nI hit publish.\nThere is no middle step.\nI hit the nearest publish button I can find.\nIt’s on Twitter.\nA momentary live performance,\nand<span> </span>then…</p>\n<p>(<em>15 years on that site,\nand all I have to show for it\nare a load of lovely friends,\nsome acquaintances who seem swell,\na weirdly web-obsessed audience,\nand a few reply guys</em>)</p>\n<p>Somehow that all leads us here.\nAn attempt at reviving\nsomething more alive\n<em>inside the archive itself</em>.\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/17/hit-publish/indiweb/\">Adding WebMentions</a>,\ncleaning up the <span>RSS</span> feed,\nand writing more…\nshort<span> </span>notes?</p>\n<p>(<em>have a thought,\nadd a commit message,\nwait for Netlify to publish</em>)</p>\n<p>I’ve also been\nreviving and curating my\nFeedly account,\nto get back in the habit\nof following other personal sites.\nMaybe even responding to them here?\nWho knows,\nmaybe there’s something to this\nidea of a\n<a href=\"https://chriscoyier.net/2022/04/29/rss-3/\">slow social</a><span> </span>back-and-forth.</p>\n<p>(<em>this is a reply to\n<a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/notes/just-put-stuff-out-there\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">\nMatthias Ott</a>,\nbut you wouldn’t know it yet</em>)</p>\n<p>I’m attempting\nto develop a new habit,\nwith this site at the center.\nNot to post more or less,\nbut to think more carefully\nabout what I want from posting\nin the first place.\nThere’s no folder full of draft articles,\nor trello board of ideas,\nor resolution to post every day.\nOnly a mental reminder\nthat\n<em>I’m already posting\nall the time</em>.\nSharing,\nreplying,\ntesting ideas,\nhaving a<span> </span>laugh.</p>\n<p><em>Social posting.</em>\nIt’s a way of thinking out loud,\nand building relationships.\nI’m just not doing it here.\nPlatforms like Twitter\nmake the flow of conversation so easy.\nToo easy, sometimes.\nOther times, just<span> </span>right.</p>\n<p>I don’t want to lose that.\nBut what if some of those thoughts –\nsome parts of the conversation –\ncould also have a home\n(and a longer life) here?\nWhat if this site wasn’t only a log of past events,\nbut a place where <em>something can happen</em>?\nSomething social,<span> </span>even?</p>\n<p>(<em>syndication really is cool sometimes</em>)</p>\n<p>The latest post from Matthias\nis a lovely reminder\nurging us all to\n<a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/notes/just-put-stuff-out-there\">Just Put Stuff Out There</a> –\nwith a well-deserved shout-out\nto Chris Coyier’s\nregular short posts\nacross a wide range of topics.\nBoth Chris and Matthias\nhave been a big inspiration\nin pushing me to try<span> </span>this.</p>\n<p>(<em>it would be super embarrassing\nif this short note spirals into a long one</em>)</p>\n<p>I already put stuff out there.\nThe problem I have here is a little different.\nI tend towards the extremes.\nI will either write\nthe most in-depth\n<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/\">complete guide</a>\npossible –\nor I will condense the entire thought\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TerribleMia/status/1534946918509342726\">into 240 characters</a>\nand hit<span> </span>send.</p>\n<p>When I do start to get precious –\n<em>ahem</em> –\nit is absolutely helpful to remember\nI can ‘just hit publish’.\nBut right now\nit also feels helpful to take a second\nand ask:\n<em>What happens after I publish</em>?</p>\n<p>(<em>I spent hours writing this,\nand yes, I’m thoroughly embarrassed</em>)</p>\n<h2>(an after-thought, a chaser, a<span> </span>postscript)</h2>\n<p>I spent part of my summer\nin 2012 at the\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/education/naropa/\">Naropa Summer Writing Program</a>.\nIt’s a weird place,\nand I had a lovely time.\nBetween classes,\nthere were often large group gatherings\nin the<span> </span>auditorium.</p>\n<p>Naropa keeps audio documentation\nof every event on campus –\na tradition that

        "html": "<p>Say you’re hungry. Where’s the first place you look for food? The farm where it’s grown, the forest where you can forage for it, the supermarket or your own pantry and fridge first?</p><p>Unless you’re living in pre-industrial times, your decision looks something like this:</p><img src=\"https://aseemthakar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled-1024x193.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"718\" height=\"135\" /><p>That last step is probably redundant in recent history but the main idea still stands. You don’t go straight to the ultimate source of food when you’re hungry. You look for the closest local link in your food supply chain (which is usually your own pantry/fridge) before moving up the chain if no food exists there.</p><p>The thing is, while we apply this process to food, we don’t apply it to our information/content diets. As software developers/engineers, this has far-reaching consequences to our productivity and mental health. We’re knowledge workers, so our consumption of information is as essential as food for us to survive and thrive.</p><p>That’s where the concept of a “second brain” comes in.</p><h2>What is a second brain?</h2><p>The phrase <em>“second brain”</em> was coined by productivity expert <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/\">Tiago Forte</a>. In his words:</p><blockquote><p><em>Building a Second Brain is an integrated set of behaviors for turning incoming information into completed creative projects. Instead of endlessly optimizing yourself, trying to become a productivity machine that never deviates from the plan, it has you optimize an external system that is more reliable than you will ever be. This frees you to imagine, to wonder, to wander toward whatever makes you come alive here and now in the moment.</em></p></blockquote><p>Essentially, a second brain is a <strong>personal knowledge management system</strong> that serves as an extension of your mind so you don’t have to think as hard or remember as much. You offload thinking and remembering to your private second brain.</p><p>Like Sherlock Holmes’ <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-memory-factory/202105/use-sherlock-holmes-mind-palace-technique-improve-your-memory\">“mind palace”</a>, it’s a place to store all of your lingering thoughts and curate the information you consume on a daily basis from books, the Internet and other sources so that you don’t get overwhelmed with unnecessary info and take action with the knowledge that matters.</p><h2>Why build a second brain?</h2><p>Most, if not all, software developers have a shot-gun approach to finding the information we need to solve issues or progress/learn new things. If we have a problem we need help with, we’ll usually follow a pseudo-supply chain that goes something like this:</p><img src=\"https://aseemthakar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled2-1024x483.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"574\" height=\"270\" /><p>As you can probably tell, there’s no “local link” in this supply chain that we’ve developed. Google is the closest link, meaning we use the massive, unsorted network that is the Internet and Google’s interpretation of our problem as our “second brain”.</p><p>By scouring the massive Q&amp;A databases of StackOverflow, the millions of videos and articles on YouTube and personal blogs or complex developer documentation, we forget one thing.</p><p><strong>We’re going directly to the farm/forest every time we need food.</strong></p><p>A “second brain” is the solution to this problem.</p><p>By building our own “second brain”, we can create our own local link in the information supply chain that holds relevant information optimised for our needs instead of relying on Google and scouring the Internet every time.</p><p>Let’s look at how you can build one.</p><h2>How to build a second brain as a software developer</h2><h3>Step 1 – Choose an application</h3><p>You need something to serve as the system that houses your second brain.</p><p>There are <a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-essential-requirements-for-choosing-a-notes-app-as-your-second-brain/\">15 qualities the ideal second brain system has</a> as specified by Tiago Forte (the original creator of the second brain concept), split into deal breakers, must-haves and nice-to-haves:</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Deal breakers</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>1. Quick capture and editing</em></p>\n<p><em>2. Scales to thousands of notes without performance lag</em></p>\n<p><em>3. Basic formatting options</em></p>\n<p><em>4. Strong search feature</em></p>\n<p><em>5. Ability to handle images and attachments</em></p>\n<p><em>6. Private space, with public sharing</em></p>\n</blockquote><blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Must-haves</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>7. At least 3 levels of hierarchy</em></p>\n<p><em>8. Many ways to capture information</em></p>\n<p><em>9. Native and web versions</em></p>\n<p><em>10. Capturing and syncing across multiple devices</em></p>\n<p><em>11. Exportable as plain text</em></p>\n</blockquote><blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Nice-to-haves</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>12. Side-by-side viewing</em></p>\n<p><em>13. Bullets or lists</em></p>\n<p><em>14. Automatic date stamps</em></p>\n<p><em>15. Tags</em></p>\n</blockquote><p>While it’s possible to use manual methods like a notebook or sticky notes, it’s difficult to scale these to thousands of notes, handle images and code snippets, allow portability for quick capture/editing and most importantly allow for searchability.</p><p>Hence why a digital system is essential (especially in the context of software development).</p><p>At time of writing, there are heaps of digital note-taking apps in the market. But, for the purposes of this article, I’m just going to list the ones that are most widely used as “second brains”/personal knowledge management systems:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://evernote.com/\">Evernote</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam Research</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app?ms.url=onenotecom&amp;rtc=1\">OneNote</a></li>\n<li><em><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> <a href=\"https://workflowy.com/hi/\">Workflowy</a>, <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a>, <a href=\"https://supernotes.app/\">Supernotes</a></em></li>\n</ul><p>All of the listed apps meet the requirements needed for a second brain/personal knowledge management system. Each app works in different ways and has its benefits and drawbacks so pick the one that works best for you. Your second brain is for your eyes and use, not someone else’s.</p><p style=\"background-color:#fff6cd;\"><em>If you use <strong>Notion, Obsidian or Evernote</strong>, you might be interested in <a href=\"https://tressel.xyz\"><strong>Tressel</strong> </a>– an app that seamlessly syncs your info from around the web (from places like Twitter and Reddit) to your note-taking apps</em></p><h4><strong><em>Related reading</em></strong></h4><a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-essential-requirements-for-choosing-a-notes-app-as-your-second-brain/\">\n<img src=\"https://fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/notes-apps-1024x705.png\" alt=\"notes-apps-1024x705.png\" />\n\n\nThe Essential Requirements for Choosing a Notes App as Your Second Brain – Forte Labs\nI’ve argued strongly for the category of notes apps as the ideal home of your personal knowledge library, which I call a “second brain.” I believe there are ten core capabilities that digital apps uniquely provide to the note-taking process: Searchability: type in a few characters and see everything that matches, regardless of where it’s … Read more\n\n<img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/cropped-cropped-Icon_Red-1.png?fit=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"cropped-cropped-Icon_Red-1.png?fit=32%2C32&amp;ssl=1\" />\n<span>fortelabs.co</span>\n\n</a><a href=\"https://nesslabs.com/how-to-choose-the-right-note-taking-app\">\n<img src=\"https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/note-taking-app-architect-gardener-librarian-banner.jpg\" alt=\"note-taking-app-architect-gardener-librarian-banner.jpg\" />\n\n\nHow to choose the right note-taking app\nThere’s a note-taking app for everyone. The challenge: it’s hard to decide which one’s the best for your use case and your note-taking style.\n\n<img src=\"https://nesslabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cropped-favicon-ness-32x32.png\" alt=\"cropped-favicon-ness-32x32.png\" />\n<span>nesslabs.com</span>\n\n</a><p></p><h3>Step 2 – Create a general-purpose structure/wireframe</h3><p>Next, we need to structure our chosen application to allow us to capture, sort and retrieve relevant information efficiently. There’s two organisational systems that stand out here:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/\">Zettlekasten</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/\">The PARA Method</a> <em>(recommended)</em>\n</li>\n</ul><p>The <a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/\">Zettlekasten</a> approach advocates for a disciplined approach to note-taking. Notes are captured “atomically” in the shortest and most modular manner possible. Once captured and split into components, you then search for other relevant notes you’ve taken in the past to link them to. Finally, you update your overall network of notes to make your recently captured note accessible. Having a network of notes is invaluable but it requires a lot of time and effort.</p><p><a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/\">The PARA Method</a> reduces the fatigue of information capture. There’s no linking needed. It involves simply splitting all information into four categories based on purpose and timely relevance:</p><ul><li><em>(Tasks) – info stored in Projects or in memory</em></li>\n<li>\n<strong>Projects</strong> – goals to be achieved with deadlines – <em>info needed now</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Areas</strong> – standards/broad categories with no end date – <em>info needed a bit later</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Resources</strong> – topics/themes of ongoing interest – <em>info needed someday</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Archives</strong> – info that you won’t use for a while and doesn’t fit into the other three categories – <em>info not really needed/held just-in-case</em>\n</li>\n</ul><p>These categories are all nested. <strong>Tasks</strong> are nested under <strong>Projects</strong> which fall under <strong>Areas</strong> which fall under <strong>Resources</strong>, with <strong>Archives</strong> serving as the catch-all category.</p><p>Projects serve as your short-term memory and hold information you’ll likely need now/soon while the deeper you go (i.e. Areas → Resources → Archives), the later the information is needed.</p><p>It’s also a good idea to have an entrypoint (or Inbox) for all of your captured info before it’s sorted into one of the above categories.</p><h4><strong><em>Related reading</em></strong></h4><a href=\"https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/remembering-what-you-read-zettelkasten-vs-para/\">\n<img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1491309055486-24ae511c15c7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ\" alt=\"photo-1491309055486-24ae511c15c7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ\" />\n\n\nRemembering what you Read: Zettelkasten vs P.A.R.A.\nI spent over a year researching better ways to take notes and remember what I read. Here’s what I found.\n\n<img src=\"https://aseemthakar.com/favicon.png\" alt=\"favicon.png\" />\n<span>www.zainrizvi.io</span>\n\n</a><p></p><h3>Step 3 – Create data structures for captured information</h3><p>The above general-purpose wireframes describe <strong>where to position and sort information</strong>, but not <strong>how to describe information</strong> to meet our needs. We need to provide the right metadata in our captured information so that it can be easily organized and retrieved later.</p><p>This single article can never hope to encapsulate every single piece of information needed by every software developer. Still, here’s some examples of information most developers need and how they can effectively store it.</p><h4><strong>Q&amp;As – <em>building your own StackOverflow</em></strong></h4><p>Q&amp;As are the most raw and direct form of information. Our search for information starts based on a question we’re looking to have answered or a problem we want solved. Q&amp;As can typically be found on sites like StackOverflow or developer forums and online communities.</p><ul><li>\n<strong>Question</strong> – the question <em>you</em> had (not necessarily the question the source author had)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Answer</strong> – the answer that helped <em>you</em> (if possible, rewrite the original answer to be more relevant to your original question)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tags</strong> – keywords to make this easily search-able in future</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Links/related reading</strong> – links to other useful information (keep your notes as lean as possible)</li>\n<li><em>(Date) – should be automatically captured by your note-taking app</em></li>\n</ul><h4><strong>Code snippets and boilerplates</strong></h4><p>Code snippets and boilerplates are extremely actionable and designed to be copy-pasted in specific contexts.

        "text": "Say you’re hungry. Where’s the first place you look for food? The farm where it’s grown, the forest where you can forage for it, the supermarket or your own pantry and fridge first?Unless you’re living in pre-industrial times, your decision looks something like this:That last step is probably redundant in recent history but the main idea still stands. You don’t go straight to the ultimate source of food when you’re hungry. You look for the closest local link in your food supply chain (which is usually your own pantry/fridge) before moving up the chain if no food exists there.The thing is, while we apply this process to food, we don’t apply it to our information/content diets. As software developers/engineers, this has far-reaching consequences to our productivity and mental health. We’re knowledge workers, so our consumption of information is as essential as food for us to survive and thrive.That’s where the concept of a “second brain” comes in.What is a second brain?The phrase “second brain” was coined by productivity expert Tiago Forte. In his words:Building a Second Brain is an integrated set of behaviors for turning incoming information into completed creative projects. Instead of endlessly optimizing yourself, trying to become a productivity machine that never deviates from the plan, it has you optimize an external system that is more reliable than you will ever be. This frees you to imagine, to wonder, to wander toward whatever makes you come alive here and now in the moment.Essentially, a second brain is a personal knowledge management system that serves as an extension of your mind so you don’t have to think as hard or remember as much. You offload thinking and remembering to your private second brain.Like Sherlock Holmes’ “mind palace”, it’s a place to store all of your lingering thoughts and curate the information you consume on a daily basis from books, the Internet and other sources so that you don’t get overwhelmed with unnecessary info and take action with the knowledge that matters.Why build a second brain?Most, if not all, software developers have a shot-gun approach to finding the information we need to solve issues or progress/learn new things. If we have a problem we need help with, we’ll usually follow a pseudo-supply chain that goes something like this:As you can probably tell, there’s no “local link” in this supply chain that we’ve developed. Google is the closest link, meaning we use the massive, unsorted network that is the Internet and Google’s interpretation of our problem as our “second brain”.By scouring the massive Q&A databases of StackOverflow, the millions of videos and articles on YouTube and personal blogs or complex developer documentation, we forget one thing.We’re going directly to the farm/forest every time we need food.A “second brain” is the solution to this problem.By building our own “second brain”, we can create our own local link in the information supply chain that holds relevant information optimised for our needs instead of relying on Google and scouring the Internet every time.Let’s look at how you can build one.How to build a second brain as a software developerStep 1 – Choose an applicationYou need something to serve as the system that houses your second brain.There are 15 qualities the ideal second brain system has as specified by Tiago Forte (the original creator of the second brain concept), split into deal breakers, must-haves and nice-to-haves:\nDeal breakers\n1. Quick capture and editing\n2. Scales to thousands of notes without performance lag\n3. Basic formatting options\n4. Strong search feature\n5. Ability to handle images and attachments\n6. Private space, with public sharing\n\nMust-haves\n7. At least 3 levels of hierarchy\n8. Many ways to capture information\n9. Native and web versions\n10. Capturing and syncing across multiple devices\n11. Exportable as plain text\n\nNice-to-haves\n12. Side-by-side viewing\n13. Bullets or lists\n14. Automatic date stamps\n15. Tags\nWhile it’s possible to use manual methods like a notebook or sticky notes, it’s difficult to scale these to thousands of notes, handle images and code snippets, allow portability for quick capture/editing and most importantly allow for searchability.Hence why a digital system is essential (especially in the context of software development).At time of writing, there are heaps of digital note-taking apps in the market. But, for the purposes of this article, I’m just going to list the ones that are most widely used as “second brains”/personal knowledge management systems:Notion\nEvernote\nRoam Research\nOneNote\nHonourable mentions: Workflowy, Obsidian, Supernotes\nAll of the listed apps meet the requirements needed for a second brain/personal knowledge management system. Each app works in different ways and has its benefits and drawbacks so pick the one that works best for you. Your second brain is for your eyes and use, not someone else’s.If you use Notion, Obsidian or Evernote, you might be interested in Tressel – an app that seamlessly syncs your info from around the web (from places like Twitter and Reddit) to your note-taking appsRelated reading\n\n\n\nThe Essential Requirements for Choosing a Notes App as Your Second Brain – Forte Labs\nI’ve argued strongly for the category of notes apps as the ideal home of your personal knowledge library, which I call a “second brain.” I believe there are ten core capabilities that digital apps uniquely provide to the note-taking process: Searchability: type in a few characters and see everything that matches, regardless of where it’s … Read more\n\nfortelabs.co\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to choose the right note-taking app\nThere’s a note-taking app for everyone. The challenge: it’s hard to decide which one’s the best for your use case and your note-taking style.\n\nnesslabs.com\n\nStep 2 – Create a general-purpose structure/wireframeNext, we need to structure our chosen application to allow us to capture, sort and retrieve relevant information efficiently. There’s two organisational systems that stand out here:Zettlekasten\n\nThe PARA Method (recommended)\n\nThe Zettlekasten approach advocates for a disciplined approach to note-taking. Notes are captured “atomically” in the shortest and most modular manner possible. Once captured and split into components, you then search for other relevant notes you’ve taken in the past to link them to. Finally, you update your overall network of notes to make your recently captured note accessible. Having a network of notes is invaluable but it requires a lot of time and effort.The PARA Method reduces the fatigue of information capture. There’s no linking needed. It involves simply splitting all information into four categories based on purpose and timely relevance:(Tasks) – info stored in Projects or in memory\n\nProjects – goals to be achieved with deadlines – info needed now\n\n\nAreas – standards/broad categories with no end date – info needed a bit later\n\n\nResources – topics/themes of ongoing interest – info needed someday\n\n\nArchives – info that you won’t use for a while and doesn’t fit into the other three categories – info not really needed/held just-in-case\n\nThese categories are all nested. Tasks are nested under Projects which fall under Areas which fall under Resources, with Archives serving as the catch-all category.Projects serve as your short-term memory and hold information you’ll likely need now/soon while the deeper you go (i.e. Areas → Resources → Archives), the later the information is needed.It’s also a good idea to have an entrypoint (or Inbox) for all of your captured info before it’s sorted into one of the above categories.Related reading\n\n\n\nRemembering what you Read: Zettelkasten vs P.A.R.A.\nI spent over a year researching better ways to take notes and remember what I read. Here’s what I found.\n\nwww.zainrizvi.io\n\nStep 3 – Create data structures for captured informationThe above general-purpose wireframes describe where to position and sort information, but not how to describe information to meet our needs. We need to provide the right metadata in our captured information so that it can be easily organized and retrieved later.This single article can never hope to encapsulate every single piece of information needed by every software developer. Still, here’s some examples of information most developers need and how they can effectively store it.Q&As – building your own StackOverflowQ&As are the most raw and direct form of information. Our search for information starts based on a question we’re looking to have answered or a problem we want solved. Q&As can typically be found on sites like StackOverflow or developer forums and online communities.\nQuestion – the question you had (not necessarily the question the source author had)\n\nAnswer – the answer that helped you (if possible, rewrite the original answer to be more relevant to your original question)\n\nTags – keywords to make this easily search-able in future\n\nLinks/related reading – links to other useful information (keep your notes as lean as possible)\n(Date) – should be automatically captured by your note-taking app\nCode snippets and boilerplatesCode snippets and boilerplates are extremely actionable and designed to be copy-pasted in specific contexts. When considering the data structure for these, note that code from one language and one context cannot necessarily be used in projects with a different language/context.Also, unlike Q&As, code snippets can’t be easily searched for based on their text contents. That’s why it’s important to put all snippets in a general structure (like a Notion database or a table with filters) that allows you to search based on language, type and context. For example, you should be able to search for all your front-end JavaScript snippets with a styling context.\nLanguage – e.g. JavaScript, Python, Go\n\n\nType – e.g. front-end, back-end, deployment/DevOps\n\n\nContext – create your own multi-select categories to further describe the purpose of the snippet e.g. is this to do with styling, making API calls, creating utility functions etc.\n\n(Description) – a text-based description of the snippet\n\nSnippet – the actual snippet/boilerplate (wrapped in code tags)\n(Dependencies) – link to any other code or packages that are relevant or that you need to use this snippet\nDocumentation templatesThese are basically text snippets. Templates for every bit of documentation your project needs like READMEs, CONTRIBUTING files, code review processes or test plans should be stored here.While these are text-based, searching for a specific document (like a README) is still not easy as it sounds. That’s why, like code snippets, it’s important to keep documentation templates in a general structure that’s able to be filtered.\nType – e.g. front-end, back-end, deployment/DevOps\n\n\nLocation – where does this template go? e.g. repository, project management, client\n\n\nTitle – e.g. README, CONTRIBUTING, QA plan\n\n\nTemplate – the actual template\n(Description) – a text-based description of the snippet\nResourcesResources are the least actionable, but most educative forms of information. They are the videos, courses, tutorials (and more) that you look for when you want to learn more about a broad area rather than fix a specific issue.For instance, if you wanted to learn about Python, you’d save the best Python learning resources (i.e. tutorials, videos, articles and courses) you’ve come across in your second brain.

I also assume that your interest is primarily on the “how” and less on the “why”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you visit <a href=\"https://person-al.github.io\">person-al.github.io</a>, you’ll see a slice of my personal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten\">Zettelkasten (or the slip-box)</a>. It’s a note-taking method I use that focuses primarily on small, atomic notes that you build on and connect slowly over time into larger and more complex projects. By publishing even the smaller notes online, my goal is to lower the barrier to conversation and learning for myself.</p>\n\n<p>Because I use <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> for my notes, Obsidian Publish is a built-in option I could use. However, I wanted to experiment with my own system first. The instructions that follow work for anyone who has local markdown notes. Here’s the rough outline of how my system works:</p>\n<ol><li>\n<a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#set-up-steps\">Set-up</a>\n    <ol><li><a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#1-set-up-github-pages\">Set up Github Pages</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#2-set-up-your-folder\">Create a blog folder in your vault</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#3-set-up-obyde\">Set up obdye</a></li>\n    </ol></li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#publishing-steps\">Publish</a>\n    <ol><li><a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#1-create-your-note\">Create a note you want published</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#2-run-obyde\">Run obyde script to convert vault files into blog posts</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#3-push-to-github\">Push changes to GitHub</a></li>\n    </ol></li>\n</ol><p>Now, let’s walk through it:</p>\n\n<h2>set-up steps</h2>\n<p>Set up is pretty easy and took 3 steps:</p>\n<ol><li>Set up a Github Pages account with a basic website and theme.</li>\n  <li>Create a folder in your vault that contains everything you want published</li>\n  <li>Set up obdye</li>\n</ol><h3>1. set up Github Pages</h3>\n<p>Github Pages is just one option for hosting your blog. You can use something completely different and follow all the other steps in this post if you’d prefer. The steps further down assume:</p>\n<ol><li>that your blog posts exist in markdown in a folder on your computer, and</li>\n  <li>that you use jekyll or hugo to generate your site. \nIf you’re not using jekyll or hugo, all of these steps except obyde will work without modification. With minor modifications, obyde should work as well.</li>\n</ol><p>I won’t go into details on how I set up my Github Page, the most up-to-date instructions will be <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">here</a>. For my blog, I went with the <a href=\"https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please\">no-style-please theme</a>, as I wanted a theme as simple and Craigslist-like as possible. You’ll notice that I <a href=\"https://github.com/person-al/person-al.github.io/tree/main/_sass\">copied the style’s css into the project</a> so I could customize it. The biggest modification I made was to remove their dark-mode support from the css file and import <a href=\"https://watercss.kognise.dev/\">water.css</a> for dark-mode instead. No-style-please implements dark-mode itself by inverting all the colors except image colors. This worked well 99% of the time, except…emoji colors would get inverted. While I could have tried to fix it, it didn’t feel worth it. My goal was simplicity, not dependency elimination. Water provides a more aesthetically pleasing dark-mode as it is, which felt worthwhile.</p>\n\n<h3>2. set up your folder</h3>\n<p>Unless you want 100% of your vault published at all times, you’ll want to set up a specific folder in your vault that contains blog posts. Name the folder however you’d like and I recommend adding two subfolders: one for drafts and one for assets. This is optional, but I’ve found it useful to have everything meant for publishing in one place.</p>\n\n<h3>3. set up obyde</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/khalednassar/obyde\">Obyde</a> is the secret sauce holding my blog together and I highly recommend it if you’re using markdown and jekyll/hugo. <a href=\"https://github.com/khalednassar\">khalednassar</a>, the developer, responds quickly and amenably to questions, pull requests, and bug reports. They deserve major kudos for this tool.</p>\n\n<p>Obyde takes a markdown file with frontmatter in one folder and converts it to a jekyll blog post file in another folder. The instructions for setup are <a href=\"https://github.com/khalednassar/obyde#obyde\">here</a>. Note that under the <a href=\"https://github.com/khalednassar/obyde#usage\">usage</a> section where it describes the config file, you’ll want to list the assets sub-folder in your vault and list your drafts folder under <code>excluded_subdirectories</code>.</p>\n\n<p>What I’ve done is keep the obyde config file in my GithubPages repo, but add it to my <code>.gitignore</code>. The benefit is that all of the code related to my blog is in one place (the GithubPages repo), but the relative path to my vault and specific folder names in my vault are not published on the internet.</p>\n\n<p>Now you’re ready to publish!</p>\n\n<h2>publishing steps</h2>\n<ol><li>Create a note with all the metadata needed for Jekyll and store in my blog folder</li>\n  <li>Run obyde script to convert vault files into blog posts</li>\n  <li>Push changes to blog to GitHub</li>\n</ol><h3>1. create your note</h3>\n<p>Create a note in the blog subfolder of your vault. It can really look like anything at all, the only requirement is that it have the <a href=\"https://github.com/khalednassar/obyde#caveat\">date frontmatter</a> so that obyde can convert it to a jekyll-style post file. This is the only change you’d need to make in order to use obyde without using jekyll or hugo. You’d either need to modify how obyde sets the post title to avoid needing the date frontmatter or, more reasonably, just add the date frontmatter regardless of whether your blog system needs it or not. Once you’ve made a few blog posts this way and have a better sense of what matters to you, consider <a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#templates-are-your-friend\">using templates</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>2. run obyde</h3>\n<p>Running obyde the standard way is a one-line command. However, I’ve created <a href=\"https://github.com/person-al/person-al.github.io/blob/main/obsidian_to_jekyll.sh\">a script to run obyde against my vault</a>. So once I’ve finished making my note and putting it in my blog older, I just need to run the script. Part of the Zettelkasten approach means that my posts get updated and modified <em>constantly</em>, so just running obyde’s default script isn’t enough. You’ll notice in the script that I delete all my posts and <em>then</em> run obyde so that it catches all the changes in my vault. Because my blog is also a github repo, I can use regular git tools like <code>git status</code> or <code>git add -p</code> to see what’s changed in already-published posts and make sure those changes are what I expected.</p>\n\n<p>Once you’ve run the obyde script, you should see a bunch of posts in your blog’s posts folder. Take a look and make sure everything is as you expect it to be.</p>\n\n<h3>3. push to Github</h3>\n<p>The beauty of Github Page is that updating anything about your blog is a push away. Commit and push your changes and your blog will rebuild within minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Congrats! You’ve just published your Obsidian vault. Now go forth and create away! After you’ve made a few posts, feel free to come back and check out the “extra goodies” below where I discuss how handle intermediate use-cases like templates, hiding private notes, and connecting with the decentralized web.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun posting!</p>\n\n<h2>extra goodies</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve made a few posts, you’ll probably need one or more of the following goodies:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#templates-are-your-friend\">templates</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#hiding-parts-of-notes\">hiding parts of notes</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#joining-the-indieweb\">joining the IndieWeb</a></li>\n</ul><h3>templates are your friend</h3>\n<p>While the date is the only required field in your post’s frontmatter, you likely have others that matter to you. The layout, the category, tags, etc. From that perspective, templates are your friend. Whether it’s Obsidian’s built-in template tool or the Templater plugin or your own third-party template system, I recommend setting up a template so consistent blog post formatting is only a hot-key away. My template looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>---\nlayout: post\ncategory: 🗨️|❔|🌰|🌱|🌳|🌲\ntitle: \"&lt;% tp.file.title %&gt;\"\ndate: &lt;% tp.file.creation_date(\"YYYY-MM-DD\") %&gt;\n---\n</code></pre>\n<p>You’ll notice that it sets required jekyll metadata like the layout and the date, as well as optional metadata that matters to me, like a list of categories for me to choose from.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I add the title to the metadata is because of a difference in how jekyll titles notes vs. your computer. In Zettelkasten, your note title is often the thesis of the note. You’ll see this in my blog with lengthy post titles like <a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B0/2021/06/19/recognition-matters-human-beings-need-to-feel-understood.html\">🌰 recognition matters - human beings need to feel understood</a>. It’s almost what you’d expect from a blog title but significantly more specific and more likely to use punctuation. Jekyll, however, doesn’t support punctuation in file titles. Which means if my file name is <a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B0/2021/08/02/i-m-struggling-with-a-piece-about-business-writers.html\">🌰 I’m struggling with a piece about business writers</a>.md, jekyll will rename that to <code>i-m-struggling-with...</code>, which will then get converted to the title “I m struggling with…”, with a weird space where the apostrophe should be. I get around this by adding the <code>title</code> metadata to the frontmatter automatically. That way jekyll never accidentally skips punctuation. The downside is that every time I change the title of a published blog post, I have to update the <code>title</code> frontmatter as well. But it’s worth it for me.</p>\n\n<p>Template or no, just make sure you have the <code>date</code> frontmatter as obyde needs it to convert your file to a jekyll-compatible blog post.</p>\n\n<h3>hiding parts of notes</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, you want to publish a note without publishing <em>all</em> of a note. Maybe you reference a person or a place that you’d prefer not to publicize, or maybe you just have a way of formatting things in your vault that will confuse public readers. Take, for example, a post like <a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%97%A8%EF%B8%8F/2021/06/27/a-dog-always-bit-deepest-on-the-veterinary-hand.html\">🗨️ A dog always bit deepest on the veterinary hand.</a> In my case, it’s just a simple quote, but in someone else’s vault it might be accompanied by an MLA citation or a longer journal entry. This is where obyde’s <a href=\"https://github.com/khalednassar/obyde#options\">find-and-replace feature</a> shines.<a href=\"https://person-al.github.io/%F0%9F%8C%B3/2022/05/08/how-i-publish-my-zettelkasten.html#fn:1\">1</a></p>\n\n<p>Find-and-replace works exactly how it says on the tin. I use it liberally. My actual post template looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>---\nlayout: post\ncategory: 🗨️|❔|🌰|🌱|🌳|🌲\ntitle: \"&lt;% tp.file.title %&gt;\"\ndate: &lt;% tp.file.creation_date(\"YYYY-MM-DD\") %&gt;\nfind: [\"find\\\\:\\\\n(- .*\\\\n)+\",\"replace\\\\:\\\\n(- .*\\\\n)+\",\"LEAVE_OUT\\\\:.*($|\\\\n)\",\"tags-for-github\"]\nreplace: [\"\",\"\",\"\",\"tags\"]\ntags-for-github:\n---\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A few things to notice:</p>\n<ul><li>I use the list format instead of the “every line” format. This is marginally worse than the every line format in that it’s much harder to count and match the <code>find</code> line elements with the <code>replace</code> line elements. But it’s marginally better in that it compresses that long list above to 4 lines instead of 10 lines.</li>\n  <li>I remove the find and replace lines themselves from the published piece. Because what’s the point in changing things if I’m going to publish exactly what changed lol.

Phrasing may be less than ideal, ideas may not yet be fully thought through. Thank you for watching me grow.",
        "text": "Assumed Audience: In writing this piece, I assume you have enough interest in publishing your own notes online that you’re looking for a detailed step-by-step of how I do things. I also assume that your interest is primarily on the “how” and less on the “why”.\n\n\nIf you visit person-al.github.io, you’ll see a slice of my personal Zettelkasten (or the slip-box). It’s a note-taking method I use that focuses primarily on small, atomic notes that you build on and connect slowly over time into larger and more complex projects. By publishing even the smaller notes online, my goal is to lower the barrier to conversation and learning for myself.\n\nBecause I use Obsidian for my notes, Obsidian Publish is a built-in option I could use. However, I wanted to experiment with my own system first. The instructions that follow work for anyone who has local markdown notes. Here’s the rough outline of how my system works:\n\nSet-up\n    Set up Github Pages\n      Create a blog folder in your vault\n      Set up obdye\n    \n  \nPublish\n    Create a note you want published\n      Run obyde script to convert vault files into blog posts\n      Push changes to GitHub\n    \nNow, let’s walk through it:\n\nset-up steps\nSet up is pretty easy and took 3 steps:\nSet up a Github Pages account with a basic website and theme.\n  Create a folder in your vault that contains everything you want published\n  Set up obdye\n1. set up Github Pages\nGithub Pages is just one option for hosting your blog. You can use something completely different and follow all the other steps in this post if you’d prefer. The steps further down assume:\nthat your blog posts exist in markdown in a folder on your computer, and\n  that you use jekyll or hugo to generate your site. \nIf you’re not using jekyll or hugo, all of these steps except obyde will work without modification. With minor modifications, obyde should work as well.\nI won’t go into details on how I set up my Github Page, the most up-to-date instructions will be here. For my blog, I went with the no-style-please theme, as I wanted a theme as simple and Craigslist-like as possible. You’ll notice that I copied the style’s css into the project so I could customize it. The biggest modification I made was to remove their dark-mode support from the css file and import water.css for dark-mode instead. No-style-please implements dark-mode itself by inverting all the colors except image colors. This worked well 99% of the time, except…emoji colors would get inverted. While I could have tried to fix it, it didn’t feel worth it. My goal was simplicity, not dependency elimination. Water provides a more aesthetically pleasing dark-mode as it is, which felt worthwhile.\n\n2. set up your folder\nUnless you want 100% of your vault published at all times, you’ll want to set up a specific folder in your vault that contains blog posts. Name the folder however you’d like and I recommend adding two subfolders: one for drafts and one for assets. This is optional, but I’ve found it useful to have everything meant for publishing in one place.\n\n3. set up obyde\nObyde is the secret sauce holding my blog together and I highly recommend it if you’re using markdown and jekyll/hugo. khalednassar, the developer, responds quickly and amenably to questions, pull requests, and bug reports. They deserve major kudos for this tool.\n\nObyde takes a markdown file with frontmatter in one folder and converts it to a jekyll blog post file in another folder. The instructions for setup are here. Note that under the usage section where it describes the config file, you’ll want to list the assets sub-folder in your vault and list your drafts folder under excluded_subdirectories.\n\nWhat I’ve done is keep the obyde config file in my GithubPages repo, but add it to my .gitignore. The benefit is that all of the code related to my blog is in one place (the GithubPages repo), but the relative path to my vault and specific folder names in my vault are not published on the internet.\n\nNow you’re ready to publish!\n\npublishing steps\nCreate a note with all the metadata needed for Jekyll and store in my blog folder\n  Run obyde script to convert vault files into blog posts\n  Push changes to blog to GitHub\n1. create your note\nCreate a note in the blog subfolder of your vault. It can really look like anything at all, the only requirement is that it have the date frontmatter so that obyde can convert it to a jekyll-style post file. This is the only change you’d need to make in order to use obyde without using jekyll or hugo. You’d either need to modify how obyde sets the post title to avoid needing the date frontmatter or, more reasonably, just add the date frontmatter regardless of whether your blog system needs it or not. Once you’ve made a few blog posts this way and have a better sense of what matters to you, consider using templates.\n\n2. run obyde\nRunning obyde the standard way is a one-line command. However, I’ve created a script to run obyde against my vault. So once I’ve finished making my note and putting it in my blog older, I just need to run the script. Part of the Zettelkasten approach means that my posts get updated and modified constantly, so just running obyde’s default script isn’t enough. You’ll notice in the script that I delete all my posts and then run obyde so that it catches all the changes in my vault. Because my blog is also a github repo, I can use regular git tools like git status or git add -p to see what’s changed in already-published posts and make sure those changes are what I expected.\n\nOnce you’ve run the obyde script, you should see a bunch of posts in your blog’s posts folder. Take a look and make sure everything is as you expect it to be.\n\n3. push to Github\nThe beauty of Github Page is that updating anything about your blog is a push away. Commit and push your changes and your blog will rebuild within minutes.\n\nCongrats! You’ve just published your Obsidian vault. Now go forth and create away! After you’ve made a few posts, feel free to come back and check out the “extra goodies” below where I discuss how handle intermediate use-cases like templates, hiding private notes, and connecting with the decentralized web.\n\nHave fun posting!\n\nextra goodies\nOnce you’ve made a few posts, you’ll probably need one or more of the following goodies:\ntemplates\n  hiding parts of notes\n  joining the IndieWeb\ntemplates are your friend\nWhile the date is the only required field in your post’s frontmatter, you likely have others that matter to you. The layout, the category, tags, etc. From that perspective, templates are your friend. Whether it’s Obsidian’s built-in template tool or the Templater plugin or your own third-party template system, I recommend setting up a template so consistent blog post formatting is only a hot-key away. My template looks something like this:\n---\nlayout: post\ncategory: 🗨️|❔|🌰|🌱|🌳|🌲\ntitle: \"<% tp.file.title %>\"\ndate: <% tp.file.creation_date(\"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\n---\n\nYou’ll notice that it sets required jekyll metadata like the layout and the date, as well as optional metadata that matters to me, like a list of categories for me to choose from.\n\nThe reason I add the title to the metadata is because of a difference in how jekyll titles notes vs. your computer. In Zettelkasten, your note title is often the thesis of the note. You’ll see this in my blog with lengthy post titles like 🌰 recognition matters - human beings need to feel understood. It’s almost what you’d expect from a blog title but significantly more specific and more likely to use punctuation. Jekyll, however, doesn’t support punctuation in file titles. Which means if my file name is 🌰 I’m struggling with a piece about business writers.md, jekyll will rename that to i-m-struggling-with..., which will then get converted to the title “I m struggling with…”, with a weird space where the apostrophe should be. I get around this by adding the title metadata to the frontmatter automatically. That way jekyll never accidentally skips punctuation. The downside is that every time I change the title of a published blog post, I have to update the title frontmatter as well. But it’s worth it for me.\n\nTemplate or no, just make sure you have the date frontmatter as obyde needs it to convert your file to a jekyll-compatible blog post.\n\nhiding parts of notes\nSometimes, you want to publish a note without publishing all of a note. Maybe you reference a person or a place that you’d prefer not to publicize, or maybe you just have a way of formatting things in your vault that will confuse public readers. Take, for example, a post like 🗨️ A dog always bit deepest on the veterinary hand. In my case, it’s just a simple quote, but in someone else’s vault it might be accompanied by an MLA citation or a longer journal entry. This is where obyde’s find-and-replace feature shines.1\n\nFind-and-replace works exactly how it says on the tin. I use it liberally. My actual post template looks something like this:\n---\nlayout: post\ncategory: 🗨️|❔|🌰|🌱|🌳|🌲\ntitle: \"<% tp.file.title %>\"\ndate: <% tp.file.creation_date(\"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\nfind: [\"find\\\\:\\\\n(- .*\\\\n)+\",\"replace\\\\:\\\\n(- .*\\\\n)+\",\"LEAVE_OUT\\\\:.*($|\\\\n)\",\"tags-for-github\"]\nreplace: [\"\",\"\",\"\",\"tags\"]\ntags-for-github:\n---\n\n\nA few things to notice:\nI use the list format instead of the “every line” format. This is marginally worse than the every line format in that it’s much harder to count and match the find line elements with the replace line elements. But it’s marginally better in that it compresses that long list above to 4 lines instead of 10 lines.\n  I remove the find and replace lines themselves from the published piece. Because what’s the point in changing things if I’m going to publish exactly what changed lol. You’ll also notice here how regexes can be used. If you don’t know what regexes are, suffice it to say that find\\\\:\\\\n(- .*\\\\n)+ is telling obyde “I want you to find a line that starts with find: and is followed by a series of bullet points after it. And then remove all of that.”2\n  An example of removing things: any line that begins with LEAVE_OUT: will not be put in the final blog post by obyde. That allows me to say, mention my mother in a relevant note while preventing such a mention from making it to the world wide web.\n  An example of reformatting: I don’t use Obsidian’s tags for categorizing. But I do want to use tags in jekyll. So instead of putting tags in my frontmatter, which Obsidian would pick up on and use, I instead have tags-for-github, which obyde smart-converts to tags when making the final blog post.\nIt takes some understanding of regexes to properly use the find-replace feature, but I highly recommend using it if you want to keep one vault and publish only a segment of it. The alternative, of course, is to have a separate vault that gets published. In that case, find-replace is unnecessary.\n\njoining the IndieWeb\nBy posting a blog, you’re already part of IndieWeb! IndieWeb is a decentralized consortium of personally-owned blogs. It’s a community dedicated to helping you own and manage your content.\n\nCorporate silos like Facebook and Twitter benefit from their proprietary formatting and following systems. Facebook knows exactly how to notify you when someone likes a post you follow, etc. With the independent web, there are some standards folks use to bring some of those benefits to a decentralized publishing ecosystem. That’s where the IndieWeb shines. I recommend going through the list of tools to see which make sense for you. I’ve made it through Level 2, which means I finished getting webmention reception support working!  I don’t yet display webmentions on the site, but perhaps that’s something I can work on soon.\n\n  \n      Find-and-replace came about from me needing to optionally hide or reformat parts of my notes as described above.

Some things were holding me back, my lack of technical competence not the last among them, but I finally did it.</p>\n<p>The final push was reading about the <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/xanadu-patterns#1-visible-links\">visible links</a> idea which makes a lot of sense to me. As that article points out, Wikipedia does hovercards for a reason, and while I don’t claim my writing is similarly important, the general idea of giving a reader more context with less effort is rather appealing.</p>\n<p>One thing that has been holding me from attempting to implement this feature earlier is mobile. Hovercards don’t make sense with touch-screen interfaces and I was reluctant to add to my website something that would be unusable on mobile.

Hovercards don’t make sense with touch-screen interfaces and I was reluctant to add to my website something that would be unusable on mobile. Not that I’m a huge mobile fan, but I try to make sure my site is available and accessible on mobile, too. On the other hand, <a href=\"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/git/\">the gitweb interface</a> is hardly accessible on mobile, either, but nor does it make real sense to access it on mobile, so I have it on my site. Wikipedia doesn’t do hovercards on mobile either; what works for them is good enough for me, I suppose.</p>\n<p>With these thoughts, I went on to get my hands dirty with the technical side of things. It was very nice of <span class=\"h-card\"><a href=\"https://jamesg.blog\" class=\"u-url\"><i></i> <span class=\"p-name\">capjamesg</span></a></span> to have <a href=\"https://jamesg.blog/2022/10/12/hovercards/\">recently sorted out</a> all the hard stuff (I know, I know, I need to teach myself JavaScript for real), so I didn’t have to start from scratch. Of course, I don’t use the backend James uses, so that’s what I needed to sort out on my own.</p>\n<p>Where should the information for a hovercard come from? The most straightforward approach is to use the information that the linked page provides about itself. For the reasons I laid out <a href=\"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/en/posts/2020/indieweb-glue/\">earlier</a>, I didn’t want to pre-fetch and store that information the way James does, so the obvious solution was to leverage <a href=\"https://indieweb-glue.evgenykuznetsov.org\">indieweb-glue</a>. Of course, it had to be taught to return the information about pages in addition to people. One form for a page to provide such information about itself is the <a href=\"https://ogp.me/\">Open Graph protocol</a>, it is rather widely used, so that’s what I decided to start with.</p>\n<p>After some mild code refactoring, I added Open Graph meta tags processing to <code>indieweb-glue</code> and <a href=\"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/git/?p=hovercard.js.git\">modified</a> James’s script to fetch the information from there. I also made it look for a specified class instead of an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag since it gives me more control over which pages and parts of the pages hovercards appear on. With some CSS thrown into the mix, it’s all working quite to my satisfaction now. Surprisingly so, I must say.</p>\n<p>As an added benefit, the same script can be used to produce hovercards for footnotes<a href=\"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/en/posts/2022/hovercards/#fn:1\">1</a> on the fly, and that’s something I’m even more fond of. Footnotes have been my pet peeve for a long time. They are a really nice instrument to have when writing a text, allowing one to avoid interrupting the flow of thought with distractions and digressions. However, in digital media, footnotes are often hidden beyond the screen edge, and scrolling or following a link to look at them is usually too much distraction. On paper, all you need to do is look down, and we are good enough at returning our sight focus back to where it was on the page so that taking a look at a footnote doesn’t interrupt our reading process too much. Having footnotes in hovercards feels like a reasonable compromise.</p>\n<p>The result is not yet perfect, and all this is still a work in progress. CSS needs more figuring out: my hovercards don’t always look good, especially when the image is in portrait orientation. Also, <code>indieweb-glue</code> could (and should) use things beyond the Open Graph protocol to extract useful info from web pages. A good example is Wikipedia: its pages lack <code>og:description</code>, but the first paragraph of the text itself looks like a perfect thing to have in a hovercard linking to a Wikipedia page<a href=\"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/en/posts/2022/hovercards/#fn:2\">2</a>. I also plan to modify the script so that it recognizes some special cases, such as <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/person_mention\">person mentions</a>, where populating the hovercard with H-Card data is appropriate, for example.</p>\n<p>Of course, I’d highly appreciate any comments, advice or thoughts on how to make these things better. For a work in progress, these are always welcome.</p>\n<p>As I was writing this post, I noticed that the first link (the one to <span class=\"h-card\"><a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com\" class=\"u-url\"><i></i> <span class=\"p-name\">Maggie Appleton</span></a></span>’s article) produces a hovercard with a nice cover image that is obviously autogenerated. Of course, I immediately wanted something like this for my posts that lack a cover image.</p>\n<p>Technically, the Open Graph protocol lists <code>og:image</code> as one of the <em>required</em> properties, meaning that every page should have one. Of course, finding a good (or even acceptable) cover image for every post can be too much hassle. There are three possible ways to deal with it: have a generic site-wide image for all the pages lacking their own images, have the images autogenerated, or have no image at all for some pages. The latter option violates the protocol, obviously, but it is used widely enough, and I also resorted to it until now.</p>\n<p>I asked around (in the <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/!vRODLVURUpxrbkRiYp:matrix.org\">Russian IndieWeb chatroom</a>, naturally). The way most people (including Maggie) seem to go about it is by using <a href=\"https://playwright.dev/\">Playwright</a>, a headless browser developed for testing, to open the page and make a “screenshot”. This is a fascinating hack, but it doesn’t quite suit my workflow. I’ve also found <a href=\"https://github.com/Ladicle/tcardgen\">a piece of software</a> tailored specifically for Hugo, as well as some more general guidelines on how to generate cover images programmatically with JavaScript or Python. Those guidelines got me really thinking, and I ended up writing a Hugo template that generates a picture automatically for every page that doesn’t have a featured image.</p>\n<p>It works, although it, too, is very much a work in progress. Image processing in Hugo is somewhat limited, and also I’m not a very visual person, so these things are always hard for me. It’s currently a very simple script that only uses the site’s favicon, the author information and the page title, and it does (almost) nothing to adapt to the title’s length (so the text would sometimes overflow or look out of place). The good thing is, most of it can be fixed with time, and the script expanded to take into account more information about the page. Still, even as it is, it’s better than nothing, I think. At least every page does have <code>og:image</code> property now.</p>\n\n<ol><li>\n<p>I know I tend to abuse this feature sometimes. <a href=\"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/en/posts/2022/hovercards/#fnref:1\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This I indeed implemented already. <a href=\"https://evgenykuznetsov.org/en/posts/2022/hovercards/#fnref:2\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

It was very nice of  capjamesg to have recently sorted out all the hard stuff (I know, I know, I need to teach myself JavaScript for real), so I didn’t have to start from scratch. Of course, I don’t use the backend James uses, so that’s what I needed to sort out on my own.\nWhere should the information for a hovercard come from? The most straightforward approach is to use the information that the linked page provides about itself. For the reasons I laid out earlier, I didn’t want to pre-fetch and store that information the way James does, so the obvious solution was to leverage indieweb-glue. Of course, it had to be taught to return the information about pages in addition to people. One form for a page to provide such information about itself is the Open Graph protocol, it is rather widely used, so that’s what I decided to start with.\nAfter some mild code refactoring, I added Open Graph meta tags processing to indieweb-glue and modified James’s script to fetch the information from there. I also made it look for a specified class instead of an <article> tag since it gives me more control over which pages and parts of the pages hovercards appear on. With some CSS thrown into the mix, it’s all working quite to my satisfaction now. Surprisingly so, I must say.\nAs an added benefit, the same script can be used to produce hovercards for footnotes1 on the fly, and that’s something I’m even more fond of. Footnotes have been my pet peeve for a long time. They are a really nice instrument to have when writing a text, allowing one to avoid interrupting the flow of thought with distractions and digressions. However, in digital media, footnotes are often hidden beyond the screen edge, and scrolling or following a link to look at them is usually too much distraction. On paper, all you need to do is look down, and we are good enough at returning our sight focus back to where it was on the page so that taking a look at a footnote doesn’t interrupt our reading process too much. Having footnotes in hovercards feels like a reasonable compromise.\nThe result is not yet perfect, and all this is still a work in progress. CSS needs more figuring out: my hovercards don’t always look good, especially when the image is in portrait orientation. Also, indieweb-glue could (and should) use things beyond the Open Graph protocol to extract useful info from web pages. A good example is Wikipedia: its pages lack og:description, but the first paragraph of the text itself looks like a perfect thing to have in a hovercard linking to a Wikipedia page2. I also plan to modify the script so that it recognizes some special cases, such as person mentions, where populating the hovercard with H-Card data is appropriate, for example.\nOf course, I’d highly appreciate any comments, advice or thoughts on how to make these things better. For a work in progress, these are always welcome.\nAs I was writing this post, I noticed that the first link (the one to  Maggie Appleton’s article) produces a hovercard with a nice cover image that is obviously autogenerated. Of course, I immediately wanted something like this for my posts that lack a cover image.\nTechnically, the Open Graph protocol lists og:image as one of the required properties, meaning that every page should have one. Of course, finding a good (or even acceptable) cover image for every post can be too much hassle. There are three possible ways to deal with it: have a generic site-wide image for all the pages lacking their own images, have the images autogenerated, or have no image at all for some pages. The latter option violates the protocol, obviously, but it is used widely enough, and I also resorted to it until now.\nI asked around (in the Russian IndieWeb chatroom, naturally). The way most people (including Maggie) seem to go about it is by using Playwright, a headless browser developed for testing, to open the page and make a “screenshot”. This is a fascinating hack, but it doesn’t quite suit my workflow. I’ve also found a piece of software tailored specifically for Hugo, as well as some more general guidelines on how to generate cover images programmatically with JavaScript or Python. Those guidelines got me really thinking, and I ended up writing a Hugo template that generates a picture automatically for every page that doesn’t have a featured image.\nIt works, although it, too, is very much a work in progress. Image processing in Hugo is somewhat limited, and also I’m not a very visual person, so these things are always hard for me. It’s currently a very simple script that only uses the site’s favicon, the author information and the page title, and it does (almost) nothing to adapt to the title’s length (so the text would sometimes overflow or look out of place). The good thing is, most of it can be fixed with time, and the script expanded to take into account more information about the page. Still, even as it is, it’s better than nothing, I think. At least every page does have og:image property now.\n\n\nI know I tend to abuse this feature sometimes. ↩︎\n\n\nThis I indeed implemented already. ↩︎"

      "content": {
        "html": "<p><a href=\"https://buildingasecondbrain.com\">Building A Second Brain</a> — это метод ведения цифровых заметок, который разработал и продвигает американец Тиаго Форте. В 2022 году Тиаго выпустил <a href=\"https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book\">книгу</a> с таким же названием. Судя по ажиотажу, который она вызвала в PKM-сообществе, эта книга обещает стать такой же популярной, как «<a href=\"https://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/kak-delat-poleznye-zametki/\">Как делать полезные заметки</a>» Зонке Аренса.</p>\n\n\n\n<span></span>\n\n\n\n<p>Метод Тиаго, сокращённо BASB, очень известен в среде энтузиастов управления знаниями и ведения заметок. Тиаго ведёт курс по своему методу, и за несколько лет курс прошли несколько тысяч человек.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Не смотря на то, что Тиаго ведёт речь в основном о заметках, его подход годится для организации всего цифрового контента: фотографий, документов, ПДФ-файлов и так далее.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В этой статье расскажу, что из себя представляет метод Building A Second Brain. Основные источники для статьи — книга Тиаго, его рассылка, а также блог, Ютуб-канал и даже Твиттер.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>История создания BASB</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Тиаго начал вести заметки не от хорошей жизни. Когда ему было 22 года и он учился в колледже, у него развилась редкая болезнь, которая сопровождалась мучительными болями в горле. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Никто из врачей, к которым обращался Тиаго, не могли не то чтобы предложить лечение, но и даже понять причину заболевания. И тогда Тиаго начал действовать самостоятельно. Он взял из клиники свою историю болезни и организовал все записи из неё по датам, врачам и их специализациям.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Потом он стал собирать записи о своём самочувствии, методах лечения, которые пробовал, и свои впечатления от них.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>За несколько лет Тиаго собрал большую коллекцию заметок на тему своей болезни. Он не смог полностью вылечиться, но разработал десяток ежедневных практик для горла и связок, специальные упражнения, которые облегчают его боль. Так он смог жить полной жизнью.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Этот же подход в ведении заметок Тиаго применил, когда стал работать в большой компании из «Кремниевой долины».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Коллеги стали обращать внимание на способность Тиаго помнить все важные идеи и мысли, вплоть до того, что обсуждалось на рабочей встрече в прошлом месяце.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Люди интересовались методом Тиаго, а он учил их вести заметки. Тогда он подумал, что это может стать делом его жизни.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Так и получилось.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Что такое Second Brain</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>«Второй мозг» — это в принципе любая система для хранения важной информации. Даже если вы просто записываете свои идеи в бумажный блокнот или Заметки Apple — это тоже «второй мозг».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Тиаго предлагает свой особый подход к созданию и организации «второго мозга», который он и назвал Building A Second Brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В первую очередь, «второй мозг» — это место для хранения заметок. В своей книге Тиаго говорит, что главная задача BASB — это эффективное управление информацией и знаниями, а знания начинаются с простой практики ведения заметок. И поэтому, не смотря на то, что Second Brain — это система из нескольких разных и взаимосвязанных инструментов, центральное место в методологии Тиаго занимают приложения для ведения заметок.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Сам он долгое время пользуется Evernote, но подойдёт практически любой другой заметочник: Obsidian, Notion, Roam, Nota, Заметки Apple или даже Google Keep.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>CODE — как построить «второй мозг»</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Процесс построения «второго мозга» состоит из четырёх простых этапов: сбор, организация, обработка и использование информации. Тиаго назвал этот метод CODE, по первым буквам слов: Capture — сбор, Organize — организация, Distill — уточнение и Express — высказывание.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Capture.</strong> Первый шаг — собрать всю интересную информации и идеи в одном месте.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Organize.</strong> Самый важный, на мой взгляд, этап — организовать свои заметки так, чтобы их потом можно было найти в нужный момент. Даже если пренебречь следующими двумя пунктами, после организации заметками можно более чем эффективно пользоваться.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Distill.</strong> После того, как полезная информация собрана и организована, нужно позаботиться о том, чтобы её можно было легко пересматривать спустя некоторое время. Информацию желательно не просто собирать в одном месте, но и пропустить через сито своих соображений, противоположных мнений и личного опыта.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Express.</strong> Полученные знания не должны лежать мёртвым грузом. Их надо использовать. Речь идёт не только о статьях или книгах, но о любом другом способе выражения. Это может быть прорывная идея маркетингового продвижения продукта, решение сложной задачи на производстве или изменение подхода к продажам в своём отделе. На этом этапе единичные мысли и идеи комбинируются, создавая что-то новое.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Дальше о каждом этапе поподробнее.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Как правильно собирать информацию во «второй мозг»</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Первый этап наполнения «второго мозга» — это сбор информации и идей. Может показаться, что этот шаг очень простой, но такое впечатление обманчиво.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Из-за ошибок на этапе сбора могут возникнуть сложности дальше по цепочке развития всей системы заметок. Тиаго, в этом контексте, сравнивает заметки с садом. Урожай в нём зависит не только от того, как ухаживать, но и от того, что ты посадишь в своём саду. Как говорится, что посеешь, то и пожнёшь.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Невозможно собрать всю информацию, которая попадается на глаза. И поэтому стоит определиться заранее, что собирать в свой «второй мозг».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>На первый взгляд самым правильным критерием может быть полезность той или иной информации. Однако, значение и значимость многих идей, информации, историй иногда невозможно определить при первой встрече. Как узнать наверняка, что эта идея или цитата из книги пригодится нам в будущем? Ведь мы порой и понятия не имеем, что нам будет интересно через год или два.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Принимать такое решение при встрече с каждой единицей информации может быть слишком утомительно для мозга и затратно по времени.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ты листаешь Твиттер и тебе попалась ссылка на статью какого-то Фёдорова, который пишет, о BASB.

Невозможно!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Тиаго предлагает другой фильтр — сохранять то, что показалось интересным. В книге он сформулировал это так —  «Keep What Resonates», сохраняй что резонирует.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В этом Тиаго солидарен с Ником Майло и его <a href=\"https://fedorovpishet.ru/noma/\">NoMa методом</a>. «Хм, это интересно» — первый этап метода Ника. Сохраняйте всё, что привлекает внимание, вызывает интерес, кажется важным.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Отдельное внимание надо уделить выбору инструмента для сбора. Мысли, идеи, информация могут поступать из десятка разных источников. Заметки, фото, ПДФ-файлы, голосовые заметки, сообщения, ссылки, электронные книги и письма, видео и много чего ещё. Поэтому лучше, чтобы в приложении для заметок было как можно больше вариантов для сбора информации.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Мне кажется, что Тиаго именно по этой причине использует Evernote. В него можно сохранять текстовые и голосовые заметки, файлы, фото, есть веб-клиппер для браузера. Навскидку я не могу вспомнить ни одного другого инструмента с такими возможностями. Даже Notion немного уступает — в нём нельзя делать голосовые заметки.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Важный принцип сбора — это сохранять всё в одном месте. Какое бы хорошее приложение мы не выбрали, не получится ограничится только одним. Пометки в электронных и бумажных книгах, записи в диктофоне, заметки от руки, сохранённые твиты и сообщения в мессенджерах — все эти места стоит регулярно пересматривать и переносить контент в заметочник.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>PARA — сортируй заметки по назначению</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PARA — это самая известная и обсуждаемая часть метода Тиаго Форте. Он назвал так свою систему организации заметок.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Главный принцип этого метода — сортировать заметки не по источнику, теме или типу информации, а по назначению. Тиаго написал «for Actionability» и, как это часто бывает, в русском языке нет достаточно близкого по смыслу слова для перевода.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PARA состоит из четырёх основных категорий: Projects — проекты, Areas — области, Resources — ресурсы, и Archives — архивы. Это универсальные категории, которые подойдут для любой информации.</p>\n\n\n\nПринцип PARA очень хорошо иллюстрирует эта картинка от <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/basb\">Мэгги Эпплтон</a><p><strong>Проекты.</strong> Это некая задача с определённым сроком, над которой работаешь в настоящий момент и у которой должен быть некий результат. Проект проще всего определить, и заметки для этой категории легко сортировать.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Например, у меня самый частый вариант проекта — это тексты для блога, канала или по работе. Тиаго приводит такие примеры проектов: спроектировать дизайн веб-страницы, пройти курс, спланировать отпуск, написать пост и другие.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Области.</strong> Это категория более высокого порядка. Область — важная сфера нашей жизни, которую надо постоянно поддерживать на определённом уровне. У неё нет ни начала, ни конца, как у проекта — так их проще всего отличить друг от друга.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Пример моих Областей: Семья, Продуктивность, Блог, Заметки, Чтение, Pyrus — компания, в которой я работаю. Тиаго приводит в примет такие: Машина, Путешествия, Здоровье, Саморазвитие и тому подобные.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ресурсы.</strong> Эта категория схожа с Областями. Тиаго даёт такое определение — ресурсы включают в себя темы, которые тебе интересны, но не подходят ни в Проекты, ни в Области.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Некоторые примеры, которые он приводит в книге, похожи на Области: Дизайн интерьеров, Заметки, Кофе, Аниме. Отличие от Областей в том, что эти темы представляют интерес, но это не то, что актуально прямо сейчас.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Так как Тиаго многое взял из GTD Дэвида Аллена, я бы провёл параллель со списками Может быть/Когда-нибудь. Можно представить Ресурсы эдакой библиотекой полезных ссылок и источников по темам, которые, возможно, пригодятся в будущем.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Например, я мечтаю писать художественную прозу, поэтому у меня есть категория Писательство. Здесь я собираю заметки и источники о писательстве. Но в ближайшее время я не собираюсь писать ни рассказов, ни романа. Поэтому Писательство лежит в Ресурсах, а не в Области.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Архивы.</strong> И последняя категория — в которую попадают заметки из выше перечисленных категорий, которые больше не нужны или не актуальны. Например, в эту папку могут попадать завершённые проекты или даже Области, которые больше не важны — такое может случиться при смене работы.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Важная особенность такого разделения — заметки, файлы и целые разделы не зафиксированы навечно. Их можно перемещать. Проект может превратиться в Область и наоборот. Допустим, ты собирал заметки о дизайне, а потом решил написать об этом книгу или выпускать обучающую рассылку.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Или вот моя папка Писательство. Пока это Ресурс, но со временем я перенесу её в Области. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>В книге Тиаго демонстрирует скриншоты своих заметок в Evernote. Эти скриншоты лучше всяких слов объясняют принцип PARA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Так выглядят папки в блокноте Тиаго.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Папка Проекты включает 11 папок с заметками в каждой: от всего двух до двух сотен, как в проекте «BASB manuscript».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Вот пример заметок из папки проекта по созданию домашней студии в гараже.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Так выглядят Области. Те из них, что относятся к бизнесу Тиаго, помечены буквами FL — Forte Labs, чтобы они были всегда рядом. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Пример заметок в Области Здоровье.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>А вот папка Ресурсы с перечнем интересов Тиаго.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В папке Архив больше всего папок.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Важный принцип PARA — этому методу необходимо следовать не только в заметочнике, но и во всех других приложениях и инструментах. Вот, например, как иллюстрирует этот принцип один из менторов BASB, сравнивая заметочник, таск-менеджер и облачное хранилище.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Чтобы определиться, в какую категорию лучше всего поместить ту или иную заметку, Тиаго советует задать себе несколько вопросов.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В каком проекте эта заметка будет наиболее полезна? Если ни в каком, то в какой области она будет наиболее полезна? Если ни в какой, то в какому ресурсу она должна относиться? И вот если и тут никакому, то просто помещаем заметку в архив.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Progressive Summarization — докопаться до сути</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Важный критерий собранных заметок — это читабельность. Тиаго использует другой термин — «discoverability». Его смысл — насколько легко понять, что написано в заметке, её главный смысл.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Чем больше заметок собирается во «втором мозге», тем больше времени и усилий требуется, чтобы их пересматривать и перечитывать. Поэтому заметки нужно делать таким способом, чтобы можно было тратить как можно меньше времени на их обзор.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Для решения это проблемы Тиаго придумал технику прогрессивного конспектирования. Чтобы улучшить читабельность заметок, он предлагает выработать простую привычку, которую многие помнят ещё по школе — подчёркивать самые важные места.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Техника очень простая. Ты выделяешь главные места в заметке, потом выделяешь главные места в этих пометках, и так далее. На каждом новом уровне нужно использовать разные виды форматирования, чтобы их было легко отличить друг от друга.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Вот как это работает, на примере одной статьи. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Сначала Тиаго сохраняет в заметке несколько отрывков из заинтересовавшей его статьи. Получается небольшой конспект. Это первый уровень конспектирования.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Он не сохраняет всю статью. В тексте заметки Тиаго указывает ссылку на источник. Так что, если ему нужно будет уточнить детали, он сможет перейти по ссылке и перечитать статью заново.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>На втором уровне он выделяет жирным шрифтом главные идеи в получившемся тексте заметки.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>На следующем уровне он пересматривает выделенное жирным и помечает в этих местах только самое интересное и важное.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Он рекомендует использовать инструмент выделения маркером, который есть почти в каждом заметочнике. Если такой опции нет, можно использовать курсив или подчёркивание.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Таким образом можно быстро окинуть заметку взглядом и понять, о чём этот текст. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Только для самых уникальных и полезных источников Тиаго добавляет саммари. В начале страницы он составляет список главных идей. Он рекомендует использовать маркированный список, чтобы был проще читать, и писать своими словами.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Метод прогрессивного конспектирования можно использовать не только для статей, но и для других типов контента: книг, видео, подкастов, лекций и так далее.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Тиаго советует не увлекаться подчёркиванием. Надо помнить, что главная цель прогрессивного конспектирования — это возможность быстро пересмотреть текст заметки и сразу понять суть. Поэтому он рекомендует, чтобы каждый следующий уровень пометок содержал не больше 10-20 процентов от предыдущего.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Покажи свою работу</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Последний этап CODE — это самое главное, для чего вообще всё начиналось: использование. Главная задача ведь не в том, чтобы собирать заметки, а чтобы они приносили пользу и помогали в работе и жизни.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Тиаго пишет, что многие часто концентрируются только на финальном результате, а все промежуточные материалы просто выбрасывают: черновики, наброски, планы, заметки со встреч. Но так не должно быть.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Информация во «втором мозге» должна стать строительным материалом для будущих работ. Каждая заметка может стать кирпичиком следующего проекта.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Смысл в том, чтобы не начинать новый проект каждый раз с чистого листа, а использовать записи из «второго мозга».</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Тиаго называет такие «кирпичики» промежуточными блоками — Intermediate Packets, и выделяет пять их типов:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Обработанные заметки. Для своих проектов можно брать информацию из книг и статей, которые ты обработал с помощью метода прогрессивного конспектирования.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Неудачные заметки. Материалы или идеи, которые не вошли в прошлый проект, можно использовать в следующих. Тиаго говорит, что не удаляет куски, которые не вошли в итоговый вариант его статей для блога, а сохраняет их.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Справочные материалы. Документы, графики, планы прошлых проектов тоже можно использовать не один раз. В книге он приводит в пример использование плана прошедшей конференции для подготовки к новой.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Готовые проекты. Куски из одного проекта можно использовать в другом.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Документы, которые делали другие. Это могут быть идеи и работы коллег или клиентов.</li>\n</ul><p>Тиаго советует всегда цитировать источники, ставить ссылки и указывать автора. Это нужно даже не для соблюдения авторских прав, а чтобы, при необходимости,  всегда можно было найти исходный источник информации. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Создавайте маленькие строительные блоки. Это могут быть сохранённые твиты, записи из дневника, цитаты из книг и статей, фото, сообщения в мессенджерах, собственные статьи в блоге и другие.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Берегите эти сокровища, перемешивайте и создавайте что-нибудь новое.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Что дальше?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Эта статья не претендует на звание полноценного руководства по методу Building A Second Brain.

        "text": "Building A Second Brain — это метод ведения цифровых заметок, который разработал и продвигает американец Тиаго Форте. В 2022 году Тиаго выпустил книгу с таким же названием. Судя по ажиотажу, который она вызвала в PKM-сообществе, эта книга обещает стать такой же популярной, как «Как делать полезные заметки» Зонке Аренса.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nМетод Тиаго, сокращённо BASB, очень известен в среде энтузиастов управления знаниями и ведения заметок. Тиаго ведёт курс по своему методу, и за несколько лет курс прошли несколько тысяч человек.\n\n\n\nНе смотря на то, что Тиаго ведёт речь в основном о заметках, его подход годится для организации всего цифрового контента: фотографий, документов, ПДФ-файлов и так далее.\n\n\n\nВ этой статье расскажу, что из себя представляет метод Building A Second Brain. Основные источники для статьи — книга Тиаго, его рассылка, а также блог, Ютуб-канал и даже Твиттер.\n\n\n\nИстория создания BASB\n\n\n\nТиаго начал вести заметки не от хорошей жизни. Когда ему было 22 года и он учился в колледже, у него развилась редкая болезнь, которая сопровождалась мучительными болями в горле. \n\n\n\nНикто из врачей, к которым обращался Тиаго, не могли не то чтобы предложить лечение, но и даже понять причину заболевания. И тогда Тиаго начал действовать самостоятельно. Он взял из клиники свою историю болезни и организовал все записи из неё по датам, врачам и их специализациям.\n\n\n\nПотом он стал собирать записи о своём самочувствии, методах лечения, которые пробовал, и свои впечатления от них.\n\n\n\nЗа несколько лет Тиаго собрал большую коллекцию заметок на тему своей болезни. Он не смог полностью вылечиться, но разработал десяток ежедневных практик для горла и связок, специальные упражнения, которые облегчают его боль. Так он смог жить полной жизнью.\n\n\n\nЭтот же подход в ведении заметок Тиаго применил, когда стал работать в большой компании из «Кремниевой долины».\n\n\n\nКоллеги стали обращать внимание на способность Тиаго помнить все важные идеи и мысли, вплоть до того, что обсуждалось на рабочей встрече в прошлом месяце.\n\n\n\nЛюди интересовались методом Тиаго, а он учил их вести заметки. Тогда он подумал, что это может стать делом его жизни.\n\n\n\nТак и получилось.\n\n\n\nЧто такое Second Brain\n\n\n\n«Второй мозг» — это в принципе любая система для хранения важной информации. Даже если вы просто записываете свои идеи в бумажный блокнот или Заметки Apple — это тоже «второй мозг».\n\n\n\nТиаго предлагает свой особый подход к созданию и организации «второго мозга», который он и назвал Building A Second Brain.\n\n\n\nВ первую очередь, «второй мозг» — это место для хранения заметок. В своей книге Тиаго говорит, что главная задача BASB — это эффективное управление информацией и знаниями, а знания начинаются с простой практики ведения заметок. И поэтому, не смотря на то, что Second Brain — это система из нескольких разных и взаимосвязанных инструментов, центральное место в методологии Тиаго занимают приложения для ведения заметок.\n\n\n\nСам он долгое время пользуется Evernote, но подойдёт практически любой другой заметочник: Obsidian, Notion, Roam, Nota, Заметки Apple или даже Google Keep.\n\n\n\nCODE — как построить «второй мозг»\n\n\n\nПроцесс построения «второго мозга» состоит из четырёх простых этапов: сбор, организация, обработка и использование информации. Тиаго назвал этот метод CODE, по первым буквам слов: Capture — сбор, Organize — организация, Distill — уточнение и Express — высказывание.\n\n\n\nCapture. Первый шаг — собрать всю интересную информации и идеи в одном месте.\n\n\n\nOrganize. Самый важный, на мой взгляд, этап — организовать свои заметки так, чтобы их потом можно было найти в нужный момент. Даже если пренебречь следующими двумя пунктами, после организации заметками можно более чем эффективно пользоваться.\n\n\n\nDistill. После того, как полезная информация собрана и организована, нужно позаботиться о том, чтобы её можно было легко пересматривать спустя некоторое время. Информацию желательно не просто собирать в одном месте, но и пропустить через сито своих соображений, противоположных мнений и личного опыта.\n\n\n\nExpress. Полученные знания не должны лежать мёртвым грузом. Их надо использовать. Речь идёт не только о статьях или книгах, но о любом другом способе выражения. Это может быть прорывная идея маркетингового продвижения продукта, решение сложной задачи на производстве или изменение подхода к продажам в своём отделе. На этом этапе единичные мысли и идеи комбинируются, создавая что-то новое.\n\n\n\nДальше о каждом этапе поподробнее.\n\n\n\nКак правильно собирать информацию во «второй мозг»\n\n\n\nПервый этап наполнения «второго мозга» — это сбор информации и идей. Может показаться, что этот шаг очень простой, но такое впечатление обманчиво.\n\n\n\nИз-за ошибок на этапе сбора могут возникнуть сложности дальше по цепочке развития всей системы заметок. Тиаго, в этом контексте, сравнивает заметки с садом. Урожай в нём зависит не только от того, как ухаживать, но и от того, что ты посадишь в своём саду. Как говорится, что посеешь, то и пожнёшь.\n\n\n\nНевозможно собрать всю информацию, которая попадается на глаза. И поэтому стоит определиться заранее, что собирать в свой «второй мозг».\n\n\n\nНа первый взгляд самым правильным критерием может быть полезность той или иной информации. Однако, значение и значимость многих идей, информации, историй иногда невозможно определить при первой встрече. Как узнать наверняка, что эта идея или цитата из книги пригодится нам в будущем? Ведь мы порой и понятия не имеем, что нам будет интересно через год или два.\n\n\n\nПринимать такое решение при встрече с каждой единицей информации может быть слишком утомительно для мозга и затратно по времени.\n\n\n\nТы листаешь Твиттер и тебе попалась ссылка на статью какого-то Фёдорова, который пишет, о BASB. Статья полезная? Нужная? Надо открыть, прочитать, чтобы понять, стоит ли сохранить её и вернуться к ней позже. Ок, определился, сохранил. И так с каждой следующей статьёй, твитом, видео? Невозможно!\n\n\n\nТиаго предлагает другой фильтр — сохранять то, что показалось интересным. В книге он сформулировал это так —  «Keep What Resonates», сохраняй что резонирует.\n\n\n\nВ этом Тиаго солидарен с Ником Майло и его NoMa методом. «Хм, это интересно» — первый этап метода Ника. Сохраняйте всё, что привлекает внимание, вызывает интерес, кажется важным.\n\n\n\nОтдельное внимание надо уделить выбору инструмента для сбора. Мысли, идеи, информация могут поступать из десятка разных источников. Заметки, фото, ПДФ-файлы, голосовые заметки, сообщения, ссылки, электронные книги и письма, видео и много чего ещё. Поэтому лучше, чтобы в приложении для заметок было как можно больше вариантов для сбора информации.\n\n\n\nМне кажется, что Тиаго именно по этой причине использует Evernote. В него можно сохранять текстовые и голосовые заметки, файлы, фото, есть веб-клиппер для браузера. Навскидку я не могу вспомнить ни одного другого инструмента с такими возможностями. Даже Notion немного уступает — в нём нельзя делать голосовые заметки.\n\n\n\nВажный принцип сбора — это сохранять всё в одном месте. Какое бы хорошее приложение мы не выбрали, не получится ограничится только одним. Пометки в электронных и бумажных книгах, записи в диктофоне, заметки от руки, сохранённые твиты и сообщения в мессенджерах — все эти места стоит регулярно пересматривать и переносить контент в заметочник.\n\n\n\nPARA — сортируй заметки по назначению\n\n\n\nPARA — это самая известная и обсуждаемая часть метода Тиаго Форте. Он назвал так свою систему организации заметок.\n\n\n\nГлавный принцип этого метода — сортировать заметки не по источнику, теме или типу информации, а по назначению. Тиаго написал «for Actionability» и, как это часто бывает, в русском языке нет достаточно близкого по смыслу слова для перевода.\n\n\n\nPARA состоит из четырёх основных категорий: Projects — проекты, Areas — области, Resources — ресурсы, и Archives — архивы. Это универсальные категории, которые подойдут для любой информации.\n\n\n\nПринцип PARA очень хорошо иллюстрирует эта картинка от Мэгги ЭпплтонПроекты. Это некая задача с определённым сроком, над которой работаешь в настоящий момент и у которой должен быть некий результат. Проект проще всего определить, и заметки для этой категории легко сортировать.\n\n\n\nНапример, у меня самый частый вариант проекта — это тексты для блога, канала или по работе. Тиаго приводит такие примеры проектов: спроектировать дизайн веб-страницы, пройти курс, спланировать отпуск, написать пост и другие.\n\n\n\nОбласти. Это категория более высокого порядка. Область — важная сфера нашей жизни, которую надо постоянно поддерживать на определённом уровне. У неё нет ни начала, ни конца, как у проекта — так их проще всего отличить друг от друга.\n\n\n\nПример моих Областей: Семья, Продуктивность, Блог, Заметки, Чтение, Pyrus — компания, в которой я работаю.

Отличие от Областей в том, что эти темы представляют интерес, но это не то, что актуально прямо сейчас.\n\n\n\nТак как Тиаго многое взял из GTD Дэвида Аллена, я бы провёл параллель со списками Может быть/Когда-нибудь. Можно представить Ресурсы эдакой библиотекой полезных ссылок и источников по темам, которые, возможно, пригодятся в будущем.\n\n\n\nНапример, я мечтаю писать художественную прозу, поэтому у меня есть категория Писательство. Здесь я собираю заметки и источники о писательстве. Но в ближайшее время я не собираюсь писать ни рассказов, ни романа. Поэтому Писательство лежит в Ресурсах, а не в Области.\n\n\n\nАрхивы.

Пока это Ресурс, но со временем я перенесу её в Области. \n\n\n\nВ книге Тиаго демонстрирует скриншоты своих заметок в Evernote. Эти скриншоты лучше всяких слов объясняют принцип PARA.\n\n\n\nТак выглядят папки в блокноте Тиаго.\n\n\n\nПапка Проекты включает 11 папок с заметками в каждой: от всего двух до двух сотен, как в проекте «BASB manuscript».\n\n\n\nВот пример заметок из папки проекта по созданию домашней студии в гараже.\n\n\n\nТак выглядят Области. Те из них, что относятся к бизнесу Тиаго, помечены буквами FL — Forte Labs, чтобы они были всегда рядом. \n\n\n\nПример заметок в Области Здоровье.\n\n\n\nА вот папка Ресурсы с перечнем интересов Тиаго.\n\n\n\nВ папке Архив больше всего папок.\n\n\n\nВажный принцип PARA — этому методу необходимо следовать не только в заметочнике, но и во всех других приложениях и инструментах. Вот, например, как иллюстрирует этот принцип один из менторов BASB, сравнивая заметочник, таск-менеджер и облачное хранилище.\n\n\n\nЧтобы определиться, в какую категорию лучше всего поместить ту или иную заметку, Тиаго советует задать себе несколько вопросов.\n\n\n\nВ каком проекте эта заметка будет наиболее полезна?

Поэтому он рекомендует, чтобы каждый следующий уровень пометок содержал не больше 10-20 процентов от предыдущего.\n\n\n\nПокажи свою работу\n\n\n\nПоследний этап CODE — это самое главное, для чего вообще всё начиналось: использование. Главная задача ведь не в том, чтобы собирать заметки, а чтобы они приносили пользу и помогали в работе и жизни.\n\n\n\nТиаго пишет, что многие часто концентрируются только на финальном результате, а все промежуточные материалы просто выбрасывают: черновики, наброски, планы, заметки со встреч. Но так не должно быть.\n\n\n\nИнформация во «втором мозге» должна стать строительным материалом для будущих работ. Каждая заметка может стать кирпичиком следующего проекта.\n\n\n\nСмысл в том, чтобы не начинать новый проект каждый раз с чистого листа, а использовать записи из «второго мозга».\n\n\n\nТиаго называет такие «кирпичики» промежуточными блоками — Intermediate Packets, и выделяет пять их типов:\n\n\n\nОбработанные заметки. Для своих проектов можно брать информацию из книг и статей, которые ты обработал с помощью метода прогрессивного конспектирования.\n\n\n\nНеудачные заметки. Материалы или идеи, которые не вошли в прошлый проект, можно использовать в следующих. Тиаго говорит, что не удаляет куски, которые не вошли в итоговый вариант его статей для блога, а сохраняет их.\n\n\n\nСправочные материалы. Документы, графики, планы прошлых проектов тоже можно использовать не один раз. В книге он приводит в пример использование плана прошедшей конференции для подготовки к новой.\n\n\n\nГотовые проекты. Куски из одного проекта можно использовать в другом.\n\n\n\nДокументы, которые делали другие. Это могут быть идеи и работы коллег или клиентов.\nТиаго советует всегда цитировать источники, ставить ссылки и указывать автора. Это нужно даже не для соблюдения авторских прав, а чтобы, при необходимости,  всегда можно было найти исходный источник информации. \n\n\n\nСоздавайте маленькие строительные блоки. Это могут быть сохранённые твиты, записи из дневника, цитаты из книг и статей, фото, сообщения в мессенджерах, собственные статьи в блоге и другие.\n\n\n\nБерегите эти сокровища, перемешивайте и создавайте что-нибудь новое.\n\n\n\nЧто дальше?\n\n\n\nЭта статья не претендует на звание полноценного руководства по методу Building A Second Brain. Моей целью было написать подробный обзор, чтобы интересующиеся методом Тиаго понимали, что он предлагает.\n\n\n\nВ идеале, дальше стоит прочитать книгу «Building A Second Brain». Но купить её сейчас будет сложновато.\n\n\n\nДля желающих познакомиться с BASB, на сайте Тиаго есть форма подписки на бесплатный имейл-курс. Заходите прямо на главную страницу, нажимаете кнопку «Yes, I want to build a second brain». В открывшейся форме надо будет указать своё имя и почту.\n\n\n\nВсего в рассылке семь писем. Письма приходят по одному каждый день. \n\n\n\nА ещё подписывайтесь на мою рассылку, чтобы получать информацию о новых статьях в блоге, и на мой канал в Телеграме, в котором я публикую посты о ведении заметок, чтении и продуктивности.\n\n\n\nА если вам нравится, что я делаю, подписывайтесь на мою страницу на Бусти, чтобы поддержать меня донатом.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tПохожее"

Also,<a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/subscribe-to-the-blog-updates/\"> subscribe to the newsletter</a> to get notified when those are published!</p>\n<h2>#Now – what I’m up to</h2>\n<p></p><img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2023.02.05-weeklylinks-content-02.jpg\" alt=\"A collage of the different stickers I made\" width=\"1061\" height=\"408\" />\n<p>I’m anticipating maybe migrating to Gutenberg (yurk). The previous format with # in front of themes is a mess with that editor. So, I’m testing a new format for those links. Reach out (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WalterStephanie\">Twitter</a>,  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephaniewalterpro/\">LinkedIn, </a> <a href=\"https://front-end.social/@stephaniewalter\">Mastodon)</a> if you have feedback on it.</p>\n<p>I’m currently working some content on <strong>biases</strong>, and some workshops on user interviews are coming soon, normally in April this year! Yeahy. We will be using <a href=\"https://shop.stephaniewalter.design/collection/user-interview-resources-templates\">some of my interview resources</a>, so, stay tuned.</p>\n<h3>Craft: some sticker printing test</h3>\n<p>I’m trying to print holographic stickers. There is 2 ways to do so:</p>\n<ol><li> you print on holographic paper (the paper has thin layer of printable vinyl)</li>\n<li>you print on white sticker paper and laminate with a holographic overlay.</li>\n</ol><p>I tested both, and made <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WalterStephanie/status/1620865819835256833\">a little comparison video</a>. I then went to ask people which one they prefer. The sample is small, but, so far, it’s 50/50 on the printing method. I also think it might depends on the color of the illustration. Personally, I think the 1st method method works better for darker illustration and the 2nd for lighter one. Then, I also tested different <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WalterStephanie/status/1621600728409149440\">cold holographic lamination overlays</a>!</p>\n<p>This lead me to another rabbit whole: paper type and print settings. I noticed some of my stickers had different colors, for the same illustrations. I thought it was the paper. So, I started doing some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WalterStephanie/status/1621585868753444864\">printing tests on different types of papers</a> and printing settings so see which ones would bring me the best result. I discovered the difference in color was linked to the setting, not the paper. Printing using “plain paper” setting (even though it’s glossy vinyl) brings out might bright colors, but we lose some contrast. A little bit as if the color were over exposed. Printing using the “matte paper” setting brings a deeper but slightly darker color. Glossy setting and photo setting bring deeper but even darker color.</p>\n<p>So, I think I found one setting + paper combo that I like. It really brings <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WalterStephanie/status/1621920020077977602\">all the nice colors of my illustrations to life</a>. I also understood a little bit better how to modify the illustrations in Procreate to get colors printed the way I want them to be.</p>\n<p>In the process, I did some research that lead me to learn more about inks, paper, light, screen display, color profiles on screen displays, etc. It’s quite nice to dig into something non UX related but still learn a lot on a specific topic.</p>\n<h2>TL;DNR the one you should not miss</h2>\n<p></p><img src=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2023.02.05-weeklylinks-content-03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1061\" height=\"408\" />\n<h3>This week’s awesome website</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.neurodiversity.design/\">Neurodiversity Design System</a>: a coherent set of standards and principles that combine neurodiversity and user experience design for for Learning Management Systems: font, typography, color, buttons, links, input, interface, communication, animations.

        "text": "On Twitter,  LinkedIn and Mastodon, I share curated articles I read, resources and tools about UX Design, User Research, UI and mobile design, HTML, CSS, the web industry, some process, some inspiration, etc. This is an archive of everything I shared this week. And some extra links that I decided to only share for the blog readers. Also, subscribe to the newsletter to get notified when those are published!\n#Now – what I’m up to\nI’m anticipating maybe migrating to Gutenberg (yurk). The previous format with # in front of themes is a mess with that editor. So, I’m testing a new format for those links. Reach out (Twitter,  LinkedIn,  Mastodon) if you have feedback on it.\nI’m currently working some content on biases, and some workshops on user interviews are coming soon, normally in April this year! Yeahy. We will be using some of my interview resources, so, stay tuned.\nCraft: some sticker printing test\nI’m trying to print holographic stickers. There is 2 ways to do so:\n you print on holographic paper (the paper has thin layer of printable vinyl)\nyou print on white sticker paper and laminate with a holographic overlay.\nI tested both, and made a little comparison video. I then went to ask people which one they prefer. The sample is small, but, so far, it’s 50/50 on the printing method. I also think it might depends on the color of the illustration. Personally, I think the 1st method method works better for darker illustration and the 2nd for lighter one. Then, I also tested different cold holographic lamination overlays!\nThis lead me to another rabbit whole: paper type and print settings. I noticed some of my stickers had different colors, for the same illustrations. I thought it was the paper. So, I started doing some printing tests on different types of papers and printing settings so see which ones would bring me the best result. I discovered the difference in color was linked to the setting, not the paper. Printing using “plain paper” setting (even though it’s glossy vinyl) brings out might bright colors, but we lose some contrast. A little bit as if the color were over exposed. Printing using the “matte paper” setting brings a deeper but slightly darker color. Glossy setting and photo setting bring deeper but even darker color.\nSo, I think I found one setting + paper combo that I like. It really brings all the nice colors of my illustrations to life. I also understood a little bit better how to modify the illustrations in Procreate to get colors printed the way I want them to be.\nIn the process, I did some research that lead me to learn more about inks, paper, light, screen display, color profiles on screen displays, etc. It’s quite nice to dig into something non UX related but still learn a lot on a specific topic.\nTL;DNR the one you should not miss\nThis week’s awesome website\nNeurodiversity Design System: a coherent set of standards and principles that combine neurodiversity and user experience design for for Learning Management Systems: font, typography, color, buttons, links, input, interface, communication, animations. Remember: those are for learning management systems. They might not apply everywhere and work for all interfaces. For example: the minimal principle in layout will conflict with the needs for a lot of complex data in enterprise software.\nInteresting frameworks and concepts\nA matrix, by Jeanette Fuccella, to help you decide when to prioritize user research, depending on problem clarity and risk:\nhigh clarity + high risk = design heavy\nlow clarity + high risk = heavy research\nlow clarity + low risk = light research\nlow risk and high clarity = skip and measure\nInteresting articles\nThe current mess in our UX Industry\nEveryone Used to Be a Designer: “4 week & 3 week sprints became 2 week sprints, and we eventually settled on de facto 5-day design sprints. At this rate, design will soon become something done by an intern for half an hour during lunchtime every other Friday.” Sad, but true.\nThe many deaths of UX design: 2023 is starting with lots of gloom and doom content about UX design, but, at least we start going beyond the “everything is alright in our industry” fluff and start talking about problems. Let’s now find how to make this better, or at least less broken?\nDesign systems, psychology , gamification and product design\nThe future of design systems is complicated an interesting read on the need for more flexible design systems and how to go there\nHow Duolingo Made Me Into a Monster, how the over gamification and manipulative patterns of duolingo can lead to very unhealthy behavior from users, who end up using the app just to stay in top ranks instead of actually learning a language\nThe hidden complexity of bank cards: interesting case studies on bank cards. But I always wonder if people who write those have business knowledge: a lot of systems in banking are quite old, sadly, designers have to find a lot of workarounds to avoid friction, but sometimes, it’s impossible.\nCustomer reviews is super important for B2C products, but don’t underestimated it for B2B and SaaS products as well. They impact revenues and conversion rate. Here are some tips to you get get reviews for your SaaS product too.\nMeasuring DesignOps with the REACH Metrics Framework interesting framework to measure and improve your design ops initiatives\nHow storytelling can supercharge your research findings, yeah, you want to avoid the death by powerpoint if you want people to check your research results, story telling and alternative formats can help a lot.\nOther interesting reads\n“AI generation is a black box: you can have an expectation of what sort of output you’ll get, but you’re essentially throwing spaghetti at the wall until the algorithm produces something that you like.”, yeah, kind of a good definition of my current issue with such tools. AI is a feature, not a product\nContracts you should never sign: there is a lot of abuse around contracts, here’s a lot of good tips on what to sign and what to not sign. Remember: contracts can (and should) be negotiated. The whole “everything belongs to the company” clause is a red flag I see often.\nInspiration, fun experiments and great ideas\nNice portfolios\nHere’s the work of Pol and Nuel, 2 frelance illustrators in Spain. I love the vibrant colorful style!\nThe beautiful work of RUDCEF, a digital artist based in Korea who draws a lot of portraits\nGenerators\nI am just having some fun with this 9-patch generator, it’s Friday so I hope you will have a little bit of fun too\nWhy code when you can use CSS generators: Text Shadow, Glowing shadow, Box Shadow, Underline (new properties), Text glow.\nGalaxy, time and beyond\nFor my space lover friends, and anyone who wants to feel how small we are: a giant picture of the galaxy where you can zoom to check specific stars\nA super cool SVG and Vue “Time Comparison” demo by Sarah Drasner: choose a city and watch the little illustration adapt to day and night\nSome nostalgia of a skeuomorphic area, remember all the glossy docs, leather icons and realistic effects we used to build in Photoshop?

Don’t miss out on <a href=\"https://datasciencesection.org/2023/02/04/february-newsletter-3/#generativeaiohmy\">more ChatGPT fun and games</a> in the middle section!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following is the February edition of our Royal Statistical Society Data Science and AI Section newsletter. Hopefully some interesting topics and titbits to feed your data science curiosity. <em>(If you are reading this on email and it is not formatting well, try viewing online at <a href=\"https://datasciencesection.org/\">https://datasciencesection.org/</a>)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always- any and all feedback most welcome!

Remember also that the RSS is now accepting applications for the Advanced Data Science Professional certification- more details <a href=\"https://rss.org.uk/membership/professional-development/advanced-data-science-professional/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the RSS is hosting a corporate workshop to discuss how the RSS can help engage employers of data scientists:  “We are looking for leaders in the data/stats profession working in the private sector to contribute thoughts and ideas to help shape the RSS corporate and membership offering that will meet the needs of data strategies across private sector organisations.”- Wednesday 08 February 2023, 9.00AM – 12.00PM in the Shard (<a href=\"https://rss.org.uk/training-events/events/events-2023/rss-events/corporate-review-roundtable-breakfast-event-(1)/\">book here for free</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s <a href=\"https://rss.org.uk/training-events/conference-2023/\">RSS International Conference</a> will take place in the lovely North Yorkshire spa town of Harrogate from 4-7 September.  As usual Data Science is one of the <a href=\"https://rss.org.uk/training-events/conference-2023/invited-session-topics/\">topic streams</a> on the conference programme, and there is currently an opportunity to submit your work for presentation.  There are options available for 20-minute talks, 5-minute rapid-fire talks and for poster presentations – for full details visit the <a href=\"https://rss.org.uk/training-events/conference-2023/submit-a-talk-or-poster/\">conference website</a>.  The deadline for talk submissions is 5 April.  Registration has also opened with an extra discount for RSS Fellows available until 17 February.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI Standards Hub, led by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-ostmann/\">Florian Ostmann</a>, is organising a <a href=\"https://aistandardshub.org/events/european-ai-standardisation/\">webinar </a>on 17th February (sign up <a href=\"https://turing-uk.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_BJ6G31VKSsOwCr0i5zNuYw\">here</a>) on harmonising standards to support the implementation of the EU AI Act. The event will feature <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastianhallensleben/\">Sebastian Hallensleben</a>, the chair of the CEN-CENELC committee tasked with developing these standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/giles-pavey-924426/\">Giles Pavey</a>, Global Director of Data Science at Unilever, was featured in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B000APNYLC/about\">Tom Davenport</a>’s new book “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-AI-Companies-Artificial-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B09Q6KHWVT\">All in on AI</a>” talking about how companies can implement AI Assurance in a proportionate manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/martingoodson/\">Martin Goodson</a> (CEO and Chief Scientist at Evolution AI) continues to run the excellent <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/London-Machine-Learning-Meetup/\">London Machine Learning meetup</a> and is very active with events.

He was exploring.\n\nIn 1983, he wrote a paper called “Power Tools for Programmers” and described his work in a new way: exploratory programming.”</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-dean-8b212555/\">Jeff Dean</a> at Google Research <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/01/google-research-2022-beyond-language.html?utm_source=pocket_reader\">maps out their plans: Language, vision and generative models</a></li>\n</ul><pre><code>“We want to build more capable machines that partner with people to accomplish a huge variety of tasks.

Remember also that the RSS is now accepting applications for the Advanced Data Science Professional certification- more details here.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the RSS is hosting a corporate workshop to discuss how the RSS can help engage employers of data scientists:  “We are looking for leaders in the data/stats profession working in the private sector to contribute thoughts and ideas to help shape the RSS corporate and membership offering that will meet the needs of data strategies across private sector organisations.”- Wednesday 08 February 2023, 9.00AM – 12.00PM in the Shard (book here for free)\n\n\n\nThis year’s RSS International Conference will take place in the lovely North Yorkshire spa town of Harrogate from 4-7 September.  As usual Data Science is one of the topic streams on the conference programme, and there is currently an opportunity to submit your work for presentation.  There are options available for 20-minute talks, 5-minute rapid-fire talks and for poster presentations – for full details visit the conference website.  The deadline for talk submissions is 5 April.  Registration has also opened with an extra discount for RSS Fellows available until 17 February.\n\n\n\nThe AI Standards Hub, led by Florian Ostmann, is organising a webinar on 17th February (sign up here) on harmonising standards to support the implementation of the EU AI Act. The event will feature Sebastian Hallensleben, the chair of the CEN-CENELC committee tasked with developing these standards.\n\n\n\nGiles Pavey, Global Director of Data Science at Unilever, was featured in Tom Davenport’s new book “All in on AI” talking about how companies can implement AI Assurance in a proportionate manner.\n\n\n\nMartin Goodson (CEO and Chief Scientist at Evolution AI) continues to run the excellent London Machine Learning meetup and is very active with events. The last event was on Jan 18th when Hattie Zhou, PhD student at MILA and the University of Montreal, presented “Teaching Algorithmic Reasoning via In-context Learning“.  Videos are posted on the meetup youtube channel – and future events will be posted here.\n\n\n\nMartin has also compiled a handy list of mastodon handles as the data science and machine learning community migrates away from twitter…\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThis Month in Data Science\n\n\n\nLots of exciting data science going on, as always!\n\n\n\nEthics and more ethics…\n\n\n\nBias, ethics and diversity continue to be hot topics in data science…\n\n\n\nWe’ll have lots more later on ChatGPT fun and games, but it felt like the artist backlash against generative AI was worth including here…\nArtists are increasingly and loudly making their case against the generative AI tools, and are now taking their cases to the courts – see more details here (where it is described as a “A 21st-cen­tury col­lage tool“… ouch) as well as a response here\n\n\n\nOne of the key arguments is that the generative models have been trained on copyrighted materials without permission – in fact Getty Images has now sued Stable Diffusion as discussed here by the PinsentMasons team (if you are worried your materials might have been included in the training data, you can check here)\n\n\n\nOf course there are similarities to the somewhat grey area of web-scraping which was ruled legal by the US courts last year\n\n\n\nAnd it’s not just images, as author Séamas O’Reilly points out\n\n\"I had hoped the entire book would be written in a flurry of nonsensical synonyms, with every word changed to an increasingly absurd alternative, like when song lyrics get spun back and forth between multiple languages on Google Translate. \n\nIn fact, the AI has presumably worked out exactly how little it needs to do to get out of trouble, and I get to the end of the book mostly bemused and, weirdest of all, disappointed by its lack of effort.\"\n\n\n\nOf course it’s not just copyright infringement… the potential for harm from generative AI, deep fakes and facial recognition is significant. We have cybercriminals using ChatGPT to help launch cyber attacks, fraudsters spoofing customer voices to demand refunds, facial images used unlawfully, and authoritarian governments infringing privacy (like in Iran tracking who is breaking hijab laws).\n\n\n\nAnd it’s not like the tools are foolproof.. as CNET as found out… “CNET pauses publishing AI-written stories after disclosure controversy“\n\n\n\nChina is an intriguing case, as while the government can often be one of the worst culprits (China Is the World’s Biggest Face Recognition Dealer), they are also at the forefront of attempted regulation, now turning to deepfakes (more detail here)\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the US government has released the final report from the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Task Force, and is becoming more increasingly involved in regulation and crackdown: Algorithms Allegedly Penalized Black Renters. The US Government Is Watching\n\n\n\nStepping back, it’s sometimes useful to remember that we don’t need AI to highlight bias in action… \n\"Changing my feminine first name to a masculine nickname on my resume gave me way more responses per application. \nJust a heads up to any other women that this could also work for. My name isn’t typically associated with a more masculine sounding nickname so I had to get a bit creative. Happy to help anyone who needs it brainstorm a nickname.\n\nI’m so tired.\"\n\n\n\nIt’s also useful to remember that there is lots of research going on to attempt to identify deep fakes and missinformation, and counter the effects of bias through more robust processes (e.g. AWS AI Service Cards)\nAt AWS, we think responsible AI encompasses a number of core dimensions including:\n\nFairness and bias– How a system impacts different subpopulations of users (e.g., by gender, ethnicity)\nExplainability– Mechanisms to understand and evaluate the outputs of an AI system\nPrivacy and Security– Data protected from theft and exposure\nRobustness– Mechanisms to ensure an AI system operates reliably\nGovernance– Processes to define, implement and enforce responsible AI practices within an organization\nTransparency– Communicating information about an AI system so stakeholders can make informed choices about their use of the system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopments in Data Science Research…\n\n\n\nAs always, lots of new developments on the research front and plenty of arXiv papers to read… \n\n\n\nSome promising research in combating Generative AI’s fluent falsehoods and identifying AI based content:\nFirst of all, we can attempt to build better models- DeepMind’s ‘Sparrow’ (actually published – but not released – prior to ChatGPT) is supposedly better than CharGPT at “communicating in a way that’s more helpful, correct, and harmless” as more learning from human feedback is incorporated. \n\n\n\nThen we have watermarking: “embedding signals into generated text that are invisible to humans but algorithmically detectable from a short span of tokens” making it easy to identify human from machine…\n\n\n\nBut who needs watermarks when you have DetectGPT which can apparently identify AI generated text without any training data, based purely on the “log probabilities computed by the model of interest”\n\nClearly Generative AI is very much a hot topic, so lots of research probing how to make the models better or trying different approaches:\nWho needs diffusion models (the piece of DALLE etc that generates the image) when you have StyleGAN-T which apparently matches existing models but with increased speed. Of course why choose either or when you could have both- using Diffusion models to train GANs…(GANs – Generative adversarial networks – are fun and worth checking out)\n\n\n\nBut now Google has released MUSE (text to image model) which uses masked transformers and is apparantly faster still…\n\n\n\nAnd not to be outdone, Meta/Facebook has released MAV3D which generates 3d videos from text!\n\n\"The dynamic video output generated from the provided text can be viewed from any camera location and angle, and can be composited into any 3D environment. MAV3D does not require any 3D or 4D data and the T2V model is trained only on Text-Image pairs and unlabeled videos\"\n\n\n\nAlso Generative AI keeps expanding from text and images…\nGoogle released MusicLM which, you guessed it, generated music from text… I know, you’ve always wanted “a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff”. And apparently, large language models are natural drummers – “fine-tuning large language models pre-trained on a massive text corpus on only hundreds of MIDI files of drum performances”\n\n\n\nAnd Microsoft published VALL-E, “a language modeling approach for text to speech synthesis” (here is a pytorch version you can play around with)\n\nOne of the key current research areas for generative models, is how best to include information external to the model (other facts or corpuses, more human feedback etc)\nOpenAI have a new model which is focused on following more complex instructions (InstructGPT)\n\n\n\nWhile “Demonstrate-Search-Predict” seems to be promising in terms of incorporating additional external information (Retrieval-augmented in-context learning); see also REACT for images (“a framework to acquire the relevant web knowledge to build customized visual models for target domains”)\n\n\n\nWe can now adapt the output images using additional text prompts with InstructPix2Pix “given an input image and a written instruction that tells the model what to do, our model follows these instructions to edit the image”\n\n\n\nGLIGEN allows different “grounding” information to be included in the prompt to better hone the output (e.g. caption and bounding boxes along with the text prompt)\n\n\n\nIt’s well documented how bad ChatGPT can be at symbolic maths problems (not really surprising when it’s sort of “averaging” over all the maths out there!) – a small research team in Austria have made some impressive improvements with SymbolicAI. Wolfram Alpha think there is lots of opportunity in this space as well … although they may be late to the game judging by this colab notebook!\n\nA regular theme in research is making the models smaller and more efficient:\nDeepMind has made progress with RETRO and Gopher\n\n\n\nAnd apparently you could save an awful lot of storage space with very limited change in performance if you switched to 4-bit precision!\n\n\n\nThis is a great concept- a prize for identifying important tasks on which language models (LMs) perform worse the larger they are (“inverse scaling”).\n\n\n\n\nGood news on the open source front with a new open source bi-lingual large language model released out of China, and an initial version of Open-Assistant released by the LAION-AI group – “Open Assistant is a project meant to give everyone access to a great chat based large language model.” If you are struggling to keep track of all the different models, you’re definitely not the only one…. this is a useful resource\n\n\n\nAlways good to see more time series research…\nWe have generative AI for text, for art (and I know it’s used in weather forecasting) so how about time series!\n\n\n\nAnd then the mouthful that is Self-supervised Contrastive Representation Learning for Semi-supervised Time-Series Classification (CA-TCC)\n\n\n\n\nAnd everyone loves some good robot research. First of all Imperial takes Web-Scale Diffusion Models to Robotics with DALL-E-BOT… And then Google attempts to “Grasp the Ungraspable with Emergent Extrinsic Dexterity“\nFinally… this blows my mind – language modelling without language!\n\"PIXEL is a pretrained language model that renders text as images, making it possible to transfer representations across languages based on orthographic similarity or the co-activation of pixels. PIXEL is trained to reconstruct the pixels of masked patches instead of predicting a distribution over tokens. \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI … oh my!\n\n\n\nStill such a hot topic it feels in need of it’s own section, for all things DALLE, IMAGEN, Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT…\n\n\n\nSomewhat unsurprisingly (given zero to a million users in 5 days as discussed last month), Microsoft has made further investment in OpenAI – reportedly $10b -(official release). Various OpenAI services are already available through Microsoft’s Azure Cloud\nDevelopment in ChatGPT continues (“OpenAI has hired an army of contractors to make basic coding obsolete”). Amazon is worried about private information (“Amazon begs employees not to leak corporate secrets to ChatGPT“) while Google is still “freaking out about ChatGPT“.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, applications and examples continue to impress:\nCreate your own app – “AI code generation for the first 80%,\nstyling tools for the last 20%.”\n\n\n\nChatGPT scored 70% on the USMLE medical licensing exam in the US\n\n\n\nAnd apparently passed a US Bar exam practice test – more validation here\n\n\n\nAn interesting case study in providing mental health support\n\n\n\nFinally lots of examples of using it to help with programming (more below) – for example “Iteratively Generating Data Visualization Code with ChatGPT“\n\nOf course ChatGPT is far from perfect, and the difficulty lies in not knowing when it is wrong. \nEven the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, urges caution\n\n\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Gary Marcus (‘deep learning is not enough…’) is keeping track of the various types of mistakes it makes\n\n\n\nAnd Yann LeCun is unimpressed\n\n\"In terms of underlying techniques, ChatGPT is not particularly innovative ... Why hasn't the public seen programs like ChatGPT from Meta or from Google? The answer is, Google and Meta both have a lot to lose by putting out systems that make stuff up,\" says Meta's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun.\"\n\n\n\nThere has been a fair amount of discussion on the use of tools like ChatGPT in education and elsewhere:\nNYC public schools have banned it – more here – although there are some proponents of it in education\n\n\n\nStack Overflow has banned it, as has the prestigious ICML (International Conference on Machine Learning)- “Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis.“\n\n\n\nAnd clearly detecting when text has been generated from ChatGPT-like models will likely be very important going forward (as discussed in the Research section above) with some tools already available (e.g. GPTZero)\n\nAs mentioned above, one area when ChatGPT like tools are causing considerable interest is in coding:\n“Replacing a SQL analyst with 26 recursive GPT prompts“\n\n\n\n“11 ways ChatGPT saves me hours of work every day, and why you’ll never outcompete those who use AI effectively.“\n\n\n\nGithub CoPilot for Machine Learning Engineering\n\n\n\nI mean if it’s good enough for Karpathy…(see the post he links to here)\n\nNice read on reverse engineering of GitHub Copilot 🪄. Copilot has dramatically accelerated my coding, it's hard to imagine going back to \"manual coding\". Still learning to use it but it already writes ~80% of my code, ~80% accuracy. I don't even really code, I prompt. & edit. https://t.co/kvQTOex9Qj— Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) December 30, 2022\nFinally, stepping back – thoughtful piece from Andreessen Horowitz (Venture Capital firm): Who Owns the Generative AI Platform?; and another musing on the educational impact of these tools (“A Chat With Dead Legends & 3 Forecasts“)\n\"The Socratic Method, named after the Greek philosopher Socrates, is anchored on dialogue between teacher and students, fueled by a continuous probing stream of questions. The method is designed to explore the underlying perspectives that inform a student’s perspective and natural interests. ... Imagine history “taught” through a chat interface that allows students to interview historical figures. Imagine a philosophy major dueling with past philosophers - or even a group of philosophers with opposing viewpoints.\"\n\n\n\nReal world applications of Data Science\n\n\n\nLots of practical examples making a difference in the real world this month!\n\n\n\nAlways good to see real world examples using cutting edge techniques – \nHere Airbnb use text generation models to reshape their customer support \n\n\n\nEbay used a large language model (BERT) to generate embeddings for their six billion items, resulting in better search and recommendations\n\n\n\nPerplexity.ai is attempting to combined generative results with search and source material to solve the trustfulness issue… with what looks to be good results\n\n\n\nAnd Carper.ai have released new code assistants based on what they call “diff models” – models trained to predict a code diff, trained on millions of commits scraped from GitHub (for ai assisted coding also check out this comparison between ChatGPT and CoPilot – they are all pretty impressive!)\n\n\n\nFinally Apple is launching a whole product range based (AI narrated audio books) on voice synthesis\n\n\"However, as with so many AI applications lately, this development raises questions about what might happen to human narrators working in the business—as well as concerns over who benefits most. If AI narrators become something readers commonly accept and enjoy, it could increase the leverage Apple and other tech companies have over publishers and authors who want as many people as possible to see or hear their work.\"\n\n\n\nIt feels like large language models specifically augmented with reputable medical domain information could be incredibly useful – and it looks like DeepMind are moving in that direction with MedPALM\nExcited to share Med-PaLM, a large language model aligned to the medical domain to generate safe and helpful answers.\n\nOur work advances SOTA in 7 medical question-answering tasks, including achieving 67% on MedQA USMLE improving prior work by >17%.https://t.co/FSSpzATotz pic.twitter.com/B0rvtUEysV— Shek Azizi (@AziziShekoofeh) December 27, 2022\nOn a slightly smaller scale… AI for smells\n\n\n\nAlways great to see new data driving better forecasting in the public domain- congrats to the ONS Data Science Campus for their work on understanding trade flows with new shipping data\n\n\n\nI’m probably not the only one who finds Boston Dynamics robots amazing and terrifying at the same time… now they can do construction… although for some reason I find this comforting…\n\nSophisticated work at Expedia on optimising rankings with cascade bandits\n\n\n\nAlso at Spotify – Survival Analysis Meets Reinforcement Learning\n\n\n\nFinally, what looks like excellent work at LinkedIn on observational causal inference “a collection of methods to estimate treatment effects when the treatment is observed rather than randomly assigned” – well worth a read both in terms of how they do and how they have scaled it with their ocelot platform.\n\n\n\n\nHow does that work?\n\n\n\nTutorials and deep dives on different approaches and techniques\n\n\n\nFirst of all more pointers on our favourite multi-purpose mechanism… transformers\nTransformer models: an introduction and catalog — 2023 Edition\n\n\n\nA practical look at Demystifying efficient self-attention\n\n\n\nDigging into Transformer-XL\n\n\n\nGreat tutorial on optimising inference of large transformer models\n\n\"Large transformer models are mainstream nowadays, creating SoTA results for a variety of tasks. They are powerful but very expensive to train and use. The extremely high inference cost, in both time and memory, is a big bottleneck for adopting a powerful transformer for solving real-world tasks at scale.\"\n\n\n\nWhy don’t diffusion models work for language tasks?\n\n\n\nThis is pretty cool- text summarisation using RLHF (reinforcement learning with human feedback) ; and another approach using Hugging Face’s Flan-T5\n\n\n\nThis is an excellent Hugging Face tutorial (What Makes a Dialog Agent Useful?) that goes through the various techniques used to make ChatGPT – definitely worth a read (more great Hugging Face tutorials, on Graph Machine Learning and Object Detection)\n\"A few weeks ago, ChatGPT emerged and launched the public discourse into a set of obscure acronyms: RLHF, SFT, IFT, CoT, and more, all attributed to the success of ChatGPT. What are these obscure acronyms and why are they so important? We surveyed all the important papers on these topics to categorize these works, summarize takeaways from what has been done, and share what remains to be shown.\"\n\n\n\nGiven the recent improvements in chat-bots, there is a fair bit of interest in applying the state of the art techniques to a custom domain (“how do I apply ChatGPT to my customer service?”)…\nHow to implement Q&A against your documentation with GPT3, embeddings and Datasette\n\n\n\nUseful background on ‘Prompt Engineering’ with relevant tools such as  OpenPrompt and PromptSource\n\n\n\nBuild a GitHub support bot with GPT3, LangChain, and Python\n\n\n\nImplementing an open source chat bot – LangChain Chat\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed a bit of a theme here –  LangChain and langchain-hub \n\n\"Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you are able to combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.\n\nThis library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications\"\n\n\n\nGetting a bit more maths and statsy…\nSuperposition, Memorization, and Double Descent – “This suggests a naive mechanistic theory of overfitting and memorization: memorization and overfitting occur when models operate on “data point features” instead of “generalizing features“\n\n\n\nHow the (Econometric) Sausage is Made – What Do You Median?\n\n\n\nWhat does entropy measure – an intuitive explanation\n\n\n\nHow to objectively pair two ranked lists\n\n\n\nGood tutorial on loading and manipulating data – “Welcome to the jungle, we’ve got fun and frames“\n\n\n\nHow Shapley Values Work\n\n\"Shapley values - and their popular extension, SHAP - are machine learning explainability techniques that are easy to use and interpret. However, trying to make sense of their theory can be intimidating. In this article, we will explore how Shapley values work - not using cryptic formulae, but by way of code and simplified explanations.\"\n\n\n\nFinally, if you really want to learn about large language models learn from the best…\nNeural Networks: Zero to Hero – A course by Andrej Karpathy \n\n\n\n“Let’s build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.”\n\n\n\nAnd of course nanoGPT – “The simplest, fastest repository for training/finetuning medium-sized GPTs”\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical tips\n\n\n\nHow to drive analytics and ML into production\n\n\n\nKicking off old-school – in praise of the plain old python function … and in the opposite direction sketch, an ai code writing assistant for pandas!\n\n\n\nAnnotating and editing training data, weeding out and correcting bad examples is always tricky to manage – cleanlab looks like a promising open source solution (also prodi.gy)\n\n\n\nIf your using Deep Learning models you’ll know how tricky they are to tune… so Google’s Deep Learning Tuning Playbook could be very useful\n\n\n\nMost MLOps platforms will include some sort of auto-retraining capability – but how important is this?

How ELT Schedules Can Improve Root Cause Analysis For Data Engineers\n“Correlation doesn’t imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing ‘look over there’” – Randall Munroe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBigger picture ideas\n\n\n\nLonger thought provoking reads –  lean back and pour a drink! …\n\n\n\nExploratory programming: what it is, why it matters, & what it requires \n“Two paradigms have always existed in computer science: one for building and one for exploring. For a long time, there was no need to put a name to them. Then came Beau Shiel.\n\nShiel was a manager working on Xerox’s AI Systems, and he was running into a problem. He was using tools and methodologies that relied on a linear roadmap, one where each step led toward an expected outcome. But Shiel didn’t know what the outcome was. He didn’t even know what the steps were. Like many data teams today, Shiel wasn’t building. He was exploring.\n\nIn 1983, he wrote a paper called “Power Tools for Programmers” and described his work in a new way: exploratory programming.”\n\n\n\nJeff Dean at Google Research maps out their plans: Language, vision and generative models\n“We want to build more capable machines that partner with people to accomplish a huge variety of tasks. All kinds of tasks. Complex, information-seeking tasks. Creative tasks, like creating music, drawing new pictures, or creating videos. Analysis and synthesis tasks, like crafting new documents or emails from a few sentences of guidance, or partnering with people to jointly write software together. We want to solve complex mathematical or scientific problems. Transform modalities, or translate the world’s information into any language. Diagnose complex diseases, or understand the physical world. Accomplish complex, multi-step actions in both the virtual software world and the physical world of robotics.\"\n\n\n\nThe century of biology – physical predictions\n\"AI is transforming the digital world. Machines can now interpret complex images and human language. They can also generate beautiful images and language—effectively propelling us into a world of Endless Media. While this will forever change our digital lives, the physical world hasn’t yet been impacted in the same way. One major exception has been biology. Here, I’ll make the following claim:\n\nBiology is the most powerful way to transform the physical world using AI.\"\n\n\n\nSeven ways humanists are using computers to understand text\n\"One of the main ways computers are changing the textual humanities is by mediating new connections to social science. The statistical models that help sociologists understand social stratification and social change haven’t in the past contributed much to the humanities, because it’s been difficult to connect quantitative models to the richer, looser sort of evidence provided by written documents. But that barrier is dissolving\"\n\n\n\nThe Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI\n\"It's like a dark forest that seems eerily devoid of human life – all the living creatures are hidden beneath the ground or up in trees. If they reveal themselves, they risk being attacked by automated predators.\n\nHumans who want to engage in informal, unoptimised, personal interactions have to hide in closed spaces like invite-only Slack channels, Discord groups, email newsletters, small-scale blogs, and digital gardens. Or make themselves illegible and algorithmically incoherent in public venues.\"\n\n\n\nSome remarks on Large Language Models\nNow, if obtaining the ability of perfect language modeling entails intelligence (\"AI-complete\"), why did I maintain that building the largest possible language model won't \"solve everything\"? and was I wrong? ...\n\nWas I wrong? sort of. I was definitely surprised by the abilities demonstrated by large language models. There turned out to be a phase shift somewhere between 60B parameters and 175B parameters, that made language models super impressive. They do a lot more than what I thought a language model trained on text and based on RNNs/LSTMs/Transformers could ever do. They certainly do all the things I had in mind when I cockily said they will \"not solve everything\".\n\n\n\nOn Analogy-Making in Large Language Models\n\"Large language models (LLMs) explicitly learn massive statistical correlations among tokens. But do they implicitly learn to form abstract concepts and rules that allow them to make analogies?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Practical Projects and Learning Opportunities\n\n\n\nA few fun practical projects and topics to keep you occupied/distracted:\n\n\n\nComposing music with cellular automata\n\n\n\nAI for Game Development: Creating a Farming Game in 5 Days\n\n\n\nSmall data projects – Arts and culture in London\n\n\n\nAsk a question… and the talking portrait responds!\n\n\n\nMake your own generative ai storyteller!\n\n\n\n\nCovid Corner\n\n\n\nApparently Covid is over  – certainly there are very limited restrictions in the UK now \n\n\n\nThe latest results from the ONS tracking study  estimates 1 in 70 people in England have Covid (a positive move from last month’s 1 in 45) … but till a far cry from the 1 in 1000 we had in the summer of 2021. \n\n\n\n\nUpdates from Members and Contributors\n\n\n\nAlison Bailey at the ONS Data Science Campus draws our attention to the UNECE starter guide to using synthetic data for those working in official statistics.

        "html": "<p>This is my monthly roundup of the books, articles, and streaming media I found interesting. Here's my list for January, 2023.</p><h3>Apps + Websites</h3><p><a href=\"https://permissionslipcr.com\">Permission Slip.</a> “It’s no secret that a huge number of companies are collecting, buying and selling data about us. Find out what information they collect, and take action to help protect yourself.” An app by Consumer Reports that checks to see which businesses hold data about you - and then helps you to remove it. Great stuff.</p><h3>Books</h3><h4>Fiction</h4><p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780765389121\">The Kaiju Preservation Society, by John Scalzi.</a> This was written as catharsis after the stress and trauma of 2020-21, and reading it was equally cathartic. The author calls it a pop song of a book, and that’s exactly right. It might not be Bach but it has a good beat and I’ll be humming it for months. If you’re looking for catharsis too, you could do much, much worse.</p><h4>Nonfiction</h4><p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780316365215\">Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto, by Tricia Hersey.</a> In a lot of ways best read as a kind of sermon on self-sovereignty, Rest is Resistance is a treatise on fighting back against grind culture and prioritizing your needs over the needs of the exploitative economic system you happen to live in. So many of these harmful ideas are baked into American culture; so much so that some of the pleas here might seem obvious to foreign ears. Nonetheless, we need more of this work, and I found this book to be both affirming and necessary.</p><h3>Notable Articles</h3><h4>AI</h4><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/the-generative-ai-revolution-has-begun-how-did-we-get-here\">The generative AI revolution has begun—how did we get here?</a> “But there was also a surprise. The OpenAI researchers discovered that in making the models bigger, they didn’t just get better at producing text. The models could learn entirely new behaviors simply by being shown new training data. In particular, the researchers discovered that GPT3 could be trained to follow instructions in plain English without having to explicitly design the model that way.” A superb introduction.</p><p><a href=\"https://futurism.com/seo-spammers-google-cnet-ai-generated-articles\">SEO Spammers Are Absolutely Thrilled Google Isn't Cracking Down on CNET's AI-Generated Articles.</a>“The implication was clear: that tools like ChatGPT will now allow scofflaws to pollute the internet with near-infinite quantities of bot-generated garbage, and that CNET have now paved the way. In a way, it served as a perfect illustration of a recent warning by Stanford and Georgetown academics that AI tech could rapidly start to fill the internet with endless quantities of misinformation and profiteering.”</p><p><a href=\"https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers\">OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour.</a> “One Sama worker tasked with reading and labeling text for OpenAI told TIME he suffered from recurring visions after reading a graphic description of a man having sex with a dog in the presence of a young child. “That was torture,” he said. “You will read a number of statements like that all through the week. By the time it gets to Friday, you are disturbed from thinking through that picture.””</p><p><a href=\"https://theredhandfiles.com/chat-gpt-what-do-you-think\">I asked Chat GPT to write a song in the style of Nick Cave.</a> “ChatGPT has no inner being, it has been nowhere, it has endured nothing, it has not had the audacity to reach beyond its limitations, and hence it doesn’t have the capacity for a shared transcendent experience, as it has no limitations from which to transcend. ChatGPT’s melancholy role is that it is destined to imitate and can never have an authentic human experience, no matter how devalued and inconsequential the human experience may in time become.”</p><p><a href=\"https://bert.org/2023/01/06/chatgpt-in-dr-sbaitso\">ChatGPT in DR SBAITSO.</a> “But it got me wondering, what if we replaced the internals of DR SBAITSO with ChatGPT but kept the weird synthesized voice?”</p><p><a href=\"https://theverge.com/2023/1/5/23540261/apple-text-to-speech-audiobooks-ebooks-artificial-intelligence-narrator-madison-jackson\">Apple Books quietly launches AI-narrated audiobooks.</a> “Audiobooks narrated by a text-to-speech AI are now available via Apple’s Books service, in a move with potentially huge implications for the multi-billion dollar audiobook industry. Apple describes the new “digital narration” feature on its website as making “the creation of audiobooks more accessible to all,” by reducing “the cost and complexity” of producing them for authors and publishers.” Speaking as a frequent audiobook listener: do not want.</p><p><a href=\"https://peopleofcolorintech.com/articles/facial-recognition-tech-used-to-jail-black-man-for-louisiana-theft-hes-never-been-to-louisiana\">Facial Recognition Tech Used To Jail Black Man For Louisiana Theft - He's Never Been To Louisiana.</a>“There were clear physical differences between Reid and the perpetrator in the surveillance footage, said Reid’s attorney. For example, there was a 40-pound difference in body weight and Reid had a mole on his face. […] Researchers have long noted racial biases in specific facial recognition software, and we’ve seen this play out in wrongful arrests, like those of Nijeer Parks, Robert Williams, and Michael Oliver—all Black men.“</p><p><a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest\">The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI.</a> “Hard exiting out of this cycle requires coming up with unquestionably original thoughts and theories. It means seeing and synthesising patterns across a broad range of sources: books, blogs, cultural narratives served up by media outlets, conversations, podcasts, lived experiences, and market trends. We can observe and analyse a much fuller range of inputs than bots and generative models can.”</p><h4>Business</h4><p><a href=\"https://axios.com/2023/01/25/americans-increasingly-disgruntled-at-work\">Americans are increasingly disgruntled at work.</a> “Of note: Workers who were in jobs that could be done remotely, but were forced to work on-site saw an increase of 7 points in active disengagement.”</p><p><a href=\"https://mcsweeneys.net/articles/macroeconomic-changes-have-made-it-impossible-for-me-to-want-to-pay-you\">Macroeconomic Changes Have Made It Impossible for Me to Want to Pay You.</a> “There’s no easy way to say this: I have made the difficult decision to lay off over six thousand of you. In the past two years, we have achieved huge wins together. But unfortunately, the macroeconomic environment has shifted in ways none of us could have foreseen, from an economy in which I did feel like paying you, to one in which I’d rather not.”</p><p><a href=\"https://longform.asmartbear.com/posts/extreme-questions\">Extreme questions to trigger new, better ideas.</a> “The following prompts jostle you out of tiny thinking. Each stretches some dimension of reality to an extreme. So extreme that it is nearly nonsense. But dramatically different perspectives can reveal distinctly new ideas. An idea that would be a 60% solution in an extreme hypothetical case, could be a 2x or even a 10x idea in reality.”</p><p><a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2022/12/05/explains-recent-tech-layoffs-worried\">What explains recent tech layoffs, and why should we be worried?</a> “Layoffs often do not cut costs, as there are many instances of laid-off employees being hired back as contractors, with companies paying the contracting firm. Layoffs often do not increase stock prices, in part because layoffs can signal that a company is having difficulty. Layoffs do not increase productivity. Layoffs do not solve what is often the underlying problem, which is often an ineffective strategy, a loss of market share, or too little revenue. Layoffs are basically a bad decision.”</p><p><a href=\"https://wsj.com/articles/your-coworkers-are-less-ambitious-bosses-adjust-to-the-new-order-11672441067\">Your Coworkers Are Less Ambitious; Bosses Adjust to the New Order.</a> “Many white-collar workers say the events of the past three years have reordered their priorities and showed them what they were missing when they were spending so much time at the office. Now that normalcy is returning, even some of the workers who used to be always on and always striving say they find themselves eyeing the clock as the day winds down, saying no to overtime work or even taking pay cuts for better work-life balance.” Good!</p><h4>Climate</h4><p><a href=\"https://theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe\">Revealed: more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets by biggest provider are worthless, analysis shows.</a>“The research into Verra, the world’s leading carbon standard for the rapidly growing $2bn (£1.6bn) voluntary offsets market, has found that, based on analysis of a significant percentage of the projects, more than 90% of their rainforest offset credits – among the most commonly used by companies – are likely to be “phantom credits” and do not represent genuine carbon reductions.”</p><p><a href=\"https://ox.ac.uk/news/2023-01-06-compound-extreme-heat-and-drought-will-hit-90-world-population-oxford-study\">Compound extreme heat and drought will hit 90% of world population.</a> “The frequency of extreme compounding hazards is projected to intensify tenfold globally due to the combined effects of warming and decreases in terrestrial water storage, under the highest emission scenario. Over 90% of the world population and GDP is projected to be exposed to increasing compounding risks in the future climate, even under the lowest emission scenario.”</p><h4>Culture</h4><p><a href=\"https://haleynahman.substack.com/p/132-the-contagious-visual-blandness\">The contagious visual blandness of Netflix.</a> “There are more green screens and sound stages, more CGI, more fixing-it-in-post. As these production tools have gotten slicker and cheaper and thus more widely abused, it’s not that everything looks obviously shitty or too good to feel true, it’s actually that most things look mid in the exact same way. The ubiquity of the look is making it harder to spot, and the overall result is weightless and uncanny. An endless stream of glossy vehicles that are easy to watch and easier to forget.”</p><p><a href=\"https://nytimes.com/2023/01/09/dining/noma-closing-rene-redzepi.html\">Noma, Rated the World’s Best Restaurant, Is Closing Its Doors.</a> “The Copenhagen chef René Redzepi says fine dining at the highest level, with its grueling hours and intense workplace culture, has hit a breaking point: “It’s unsustainable.”” Time to close with one last audacious s’mores dish?</p><h4>Democracy</h4><p><a href=\"https://dailytarheel.com/article/2023/01/university-unc-leaders-blindsided-trustees-decision-professional-school\">‘I’m flabbergasted’: UNC leaders blindsided by trustees' decision on School of Civic Life and Leadership.</a>“Mimi Chapman, chairperson of faculty, said she was “flabbergasted” in response to the exclusion of faculty input in the decision, which she said she considers to be an attack on shared University governance.” From the same university that denied tenure to Nikole Hannah-Jones.</p><p><a href=\"https://vox.com/policy-and-politics/23573220/adam-schiff-california-senate-race-katie-porter-dianne-feinstein\">Adam Schiff to run against Porter for Feinstein’s California Senate seat.</a> “Lee is an old-school, anti-establishment liberal with widespread name recognition in the Bay Area. Khanna has built more of a name for himself as a technocrat and wonk in the tech, antitrust, and economic realm, and co-chaired Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign.

Layoffs often do not increase stock prices, in part because layoffs can signal that a company is having difficulty. Layoffs do not increase productivity. Layoffs do not solve what is often the underlying problem, which is often an ineffective strategy, a loss of market share, or too little revenue. Layoffs are basically a bad decision.”Your Coworkers Are Less Ambitious; Bosses Adjust to the New Order. “Many white-collar workers say the events of the past three years have reordered their priorities and showed them what they were missing when they were spending so much time at the office. Now that normalcy is returning, even some of the workers who used to be always on and always striving say they find themselves eyeing the clock as the day winds down, saying no to overtime work or even taking pay cuts for better work-life balance.” Good!ClimateRevealed: more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets by biggest provider are worthless, analysis shows.“The research into Verra, the world’s leading carbon standard for the rapidly growing $2bn (£1.6bn) voluntary offsets market, has found that, based on analysis of a significant percentage of the projects, more than 90% of their rainforest offset credits – among the most commonly used by companies – are likely to be “phantom credits” and do not represent genuine carbon reductions.”Compound extreme heat and drought will hit 90% of world population. “The frequency of extreme compounding hazards is projected to intensify tenfold globally due to the combined effects of warming and decreases in terrestrial water storage, under the highest emission scenario. Over 90% of the world population and GDP is projected to be exposed to increasing compounding risks in the future climate, even under the lowest emission scenario.”CultureThe contagious visual blandness of Netflix. “There are more green screens and sound stages, more CGI, more fixing-it-in-post. As these production tools have gotten slicker and cheaper and thus more widely abused, it’s not that everything looks obviously shitty or too good to feel true, it’s actually that most things look mid in the exact same way. The ubiquity of the look is making it harder to spot, and the overall result is weightless and uncanny. An endless stream of glossy vehicles that are easy to watch and easier to forget.”Noma, Rated the World’s Best Restaurant, Is Closing Its Doors. “The Copenhagen chef René Redzepi says fine dining at the highest level, with its grueling hours and intense workplace culture, has hit a breaking point: “It’s unsustainable.”” Time to close with one last audacious s’mores dish?Democracy‘I’m flabbergasted’: UNC leaders blindsided by trustees' decision on School of Civic Life and Leadership.“Mimi Chapman, chairperson of faculty, said she was “flabbergasted” in response to the exclusion of faculty input in the decision, which she said she considers to be an attack on shared University governance.” From the same university that denied tenure to Nikole Hannah-Jones.Adam Schiff to run against Porter for Feinstein’s California Senate seat. “Lee is an old-school, anti-establishment liberal with widespread name recognition in the Bay Area. Khanna has built more of a name for himself as a technocrat and wonk in the tech, antitrust, and economic realm, and co-chaired Bernie Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign. Porter comes from the Elizabeth Warren lane of the party. But Schiff’s congressional identity has been shaped by his establishment ties.”Election workers could see expanded protections as threats continue. “While election workers mostly powered through a smooth process in November, the threat of political violence continues, according to election officials and voting rights advocates. Ramping up protections for election workers will be critical this year for legislatures.”NPR obtained secret tapes recorded by prison staff during Virginia executions. “An NPR investigation can now reveal the tapes show the prison neglected to record key evidence during what was considered one of Virginia’s worst executions, and staff appeared unprepared for some of the jobs they were tasked to do in the death chamber.”Donelan confirms stiffer online safety measures after backbench pressure. “Under a further change to the bill, video footage that shows people crossing the Channel in small boats in a “positive light” will be added to a list of illegal content that all tech platforms must proactively prevent from reaching users.” How is this internet safety?!Missouri House faces backlash for women’s dress code rule. “Democrats have excoriated Republicans on social media for legislating over what women should be required to wear. Criticism of the rule change comes at a time when the treatment of women in Missouri has received national attention.”Spot the difference: Boris Johnson appears scrubbed from photo posted by Shapps. “Social media users were quick to point out that Johnson appeared to have been erased from the image – an identical picture is still on the No 10 Flickr account, dated 9 June 2021, with the former PM standing between Shapps and Hart.” How very Stalin of him.‘It never stops’: killings by US police reach record high in 2022. “US law enforcement killed at least 1,176 people in 2022, making it the deadliest year on record for police violence since experts first started tracking the killings, a new data analysis reveals.”These anti-trans bills are being prepped for 2023 state legislative sessions. “Lawmakers in at least eight states used the last two months of 2022 to prefile anti-transgender bills ahead of state legislative sessions convening this month — setting up another year of statehouse battles over trans rights, while targeting health care for trans adults in new ways.”The secret money fueling the conservative anti-ESG push. “This isn’t a grassroots movement, and it isn’t coming from the financial industry, where most experts argue that considering issues like climate is prudent for investors. “I think it’s motivated by politics,” says Witold Henisz, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “They think it’s a political wedge issue. You can see some of the same patterns of money moving into the anti-ESG movement that pushed back against climate science in the aughts.””A Con Man Is Succeeding Me in Congress Today. “But for now, there is no getting around the fact that Mr. Santos’s con game is a manifestation of a growing political phenomenon of saying or doing anything, with no automatic consequences. Whether it be far-right election deniers, personal attacks that call for violence against opponents, claims of false-flag mass shootings, extremists spouting the first thing that comes to mind and even one politician saying he could “shoot somebody” on Fifth Avenue and still not lose supporters.”HealthHow our microbiome is shaped by family, friends and even neighbours. “People living in the same household share more than just a roof. Be they family or flatmate, housemates tend to have the same microbes colonizing their bodies, and the longer the cohabitation, the more similar these microbiomes become. The conclusion raises the possibility that diseases linked to microbiome dysfunction, including cancer, diabetes and obesity, could be partly transmissible.”Gas stove health concerns add urgency to calls for changes in public housing. “Alarmingly, in a focus group conducted by the Public Health Law Center in Chicago, nearly 100 percent of public housing participants said they have also turned on their gas stoves to stay warm on cold days, which is an added danger for residents.”Population Attributable Fraction of Gas Stoves and Childhood Asthma in the United States. “The proportion of childhood asthma that could be theoretically prevented if gas stove use was not present (e.g., state-specific PAFs) varied by state (Illinois = 21.1%; California = 20.1%; New York = 18.8%; Massachusetts = 15.4%; Pennsylvania = 13.5%). Our results quantify the US public health burden attributed to gas stove use and childhood asthma.”Lead and Cadmium Could Be in Your Dark Chocolate. “The chocolate industry has been grappling with ways to lower those levels. To see how much of a risk these favorite treats pose, Consumer Reports scientists recently measured the amount of heavy metals in 28 dark chocolate bars. They detected cadmium and lead in all of them.”MediaNewsrooms that move beyond ‘objectivity’ can build trust. “Newer, nonprofit news organizations often have launched with stated missions. The national digital news site the 19th, for example, aims to “elevate voices of women, people of color, and the LGBTQ+ community.””Three years of The 19th: 30 cities, 54 employees and news that represents. “In the last year alone, we’ve grown at an astronomical pace: from 32 employees to 54, from a news organization that pledged to be the most representative in the nation to one where 65 percent of our staff is non-White, 30 percent are LGBTQ+ and 19 percent are living with disabilities. We’re now on the ground in more than 30 U.S. cities.” I’m so proud to be a part of this team.Layoff Brain. “Layoffs are the worst for the people who lose their job, but there’s a ripple effect on those who keep them — particularly if they keep them over the course of multiple layoffs. It’s a curious mix of guilt, relief, trepidation, and anger. Are you supposed to be grateful to the company whose primary leadership strategy seems to be keeping its workers trapped in fear? How do you trust your manager’s assurances of security further than the end of the next pay period?”Trump Looks to Abandon Truth Social, His Own Social Media Platform. “Since late last year, former President Trump has informed several people close to him that he doesn’t want to re-up the exclusivity agreement with his social media company, Truth Social, two sources familiar with the matter tell Rolling Stone. “There’s not going to be a need for that,” is how one of the sources recalls Trump describing his soon-to-expire contractual obligation. […] Trump and some of his close allies have already brainstormed about him tweeting that, even though Big Tech tried to “silence” him over his lies about a “rigged election,” he was now back to make “the Left” miserable.”Journalists (And Others) Should Leave Twitter. Here’s How They Can Get Started. “Many journalism organizations and public entities, such as local governments, believe Twitter is essential because it’s a place people know they can turn to when there’s big news — and find information from “verified accounts” that (barring a hack) ensure the source is who it’s claiming to be. So, they tell themselves, they have to stick around. This isn’t just short-sighted. It’s foolish.”Publishers, you should start using Mastodon: 10 reasons why. “There are plenty of articles about why you should leave Twitter (or at least, cross-post to Mastodon) for ethical, safety, political, social, and security/privacy reasons. This post won’t do any of those things. Instead, all my arguments are about why it’s smart from a pure business, marketing, and influence perspective to use Mastodon as soon as possible.”ScienceU.S.D.A. Approves First Vaccine for Honeybees. ““There are millions of beehives all over the world, and they don’t have a good health care system compared to other animals,” she said. “Now we have the tools to improve their resistance against diseases.”” Vaccines for bees!SocietyA vast majority of Americans are concerned people could face criminal penalties for abortion. “The data found that 80 percent of Americans are concerned that domestic abuse survivors could be reported by their abuser for getting an abortion. Eighty percent of people are also concerned that law enforcement could investigate people who have miscarriages or stillbirths if they are suspected of getting an abortion. The poll also found that 75 percent of people are concerned that people who get an abortion could be charged with a felony or go to jail.”Inside a US Neo-Nazi Homeschool Network With Thousands of Members. “Since the group began in October 2021 it has openly embraced Nazi ideology and promoted white supremacy, while proudly discouraging parents from letting their white children play with or have any contact with people of any other race. Admins and members use racist, homophobic, and antisemitic slurs without shame, and quote Hitler and other Nazi leaders daily in a channel open to the public.”The tragedy of the commons is a false and dangerous myth. “Even before Hardin’s ‘The Tragedy of the Commons’ was published, however, the young political scientist Elinor Ostrom had proven him wrong. While Hardin speculated that the tragedy of the commons could be avoided only through total privatisation or total government control, Ostrom had witnessed groundwater users near her native Los Angeles hammer out a system for sharing their coveted resource.”Pain of police killings ripples outward to traumatize Black people and communities across US. “Evidence shows that many Black Americans across the U.S. experience police killings of other Black people as traumatic events, and that this trauma diminishes the ability of Black communities to thrive.” Sobering statistics.U.S. Officials Announce Plans To Continue Pretending Brutal State-Sponsored Violence Not Supposed To Happen. ““Today, as we deal with the fallout from the death of Tyre Nichols, myself and the highest officials in the American government pledge to keep acting like we don’t want our highly militarized police force to kill innocent civilians every day,” said President Joe Biden at a White House press conference, adding that he and his fellow elected officials would pretend to gasp, pray, and put on a big emotional show every time law enforcement carried out the exact murders against its own citizens they had both tacitly and publicly approved.”Unionization increased by 200,000 in 2022: Tens of millions more wanted to join a union, but couldn’t .“One crucial way we can promote a more prosperous, equitable economy is to dismantle existing barriers to union organizing and collective bargaining. It is urgent that policymakers enact reforms at the federal and state levels to protect and support workers’ right to unionize.”Why Elon Musk and the billionaire space bros want to put people in space cages forever. “That said, I disagree with Mr. Wanjek: it requires much more than libertarian naiveté to colonize space. Parking humans in containment shelters, on Mars or elsewhere, so as to breed them and select them like cattle — that requires malice.”2023 'Doomsday Clock' moved 10 seconds closer to catastrophe. “Scientists revealed on Tuesday that the “Doomsday Clock” has been moved up to 90 seconds before midnight -- the closest humanity has ever been to armageddon.” But everything else is going so well.Post-Roe March for Life showed anti-abortion activists are far from done. “The next steps for the movement were illustrated by the march’s new route this year: Instead of ending at the steps of the Supreme Court as they have for nearly five decades, activists ended their march at the U.S. Capitol — underscoring their continued push for Congress to enact a federal abortion ban.”Anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and state laws are hurting youth mental health, poll shows. “Seventy-one percent of the 716 surveyed LGBTQ+ youth, ranging from teenagers to young adults who took the online poll last fall, said that debates around state laws restricting the rights of LGBTQ+ young people had negatively impacted their mental health. Twenty-seven percent characterized the negative effect as severe.”We Convinced Our School to Bring Back Masks. “As parents, it’s worth remembering that the persistent ones usually get what they want. Look at the anti-maskers. They didn’t give up. They kept pushing until they got their way. We don’t need to be that aggressive, but I think a lot of us get discouraged and give up. The anti-masker types never give up. They never seem to get tired. So if we want to beat them and win over middle earth, we have to match their energy.”Elon Musk-funded nonprofit run by MIT professor offered to finance Swedish pro-nazi group. “The US-based and Elon Musk-funded Future of Life Institute, run by MIT professor and Swedish citizen Max Tegmark, offered a grant of $100,000 to right-wing extremists in Sweden, an Expo investigation reveals.”Public Transit Goes Off the Rails With Fewer Riders, Dwindling Cash, Rising Crime. “Several of the nation’s largest urban mass-transit systems are at a crossroads, with ridership still depressed three years into the pandemic and federal aid running out.”TechnologyInstagram's co-founders are mounting a comeback. “TikTok’s innovation was to show you stuff using only algorithmic predictions, regardless of who your friends are or who you followed. It soon became the most downloaded app in the world. Artifact represents an effort to do the same thing, but for text.” Potentially an interesting app, based on an interesting insight.Women, minorities lose ground in tech layoffs. “The technology industry has long struggled to recruit a diverse workforce, but the recent spate of cuts by Silicon Valley companies has hit women particularly hard, according to recently published analyses of demographic data from the layoffs. Women and some minorities were particularly vulnerable to layoffs because they were newer to their jobs and occupied roles that companies were less interested in retaining, experts said.”U.S. sues Google for allegedly breaking antitrust laws with its ad business. ““For 15 years, Google has pursued a course of anticompetitive conduct that has allowed it to halt the rise of rival technologies, manipulate auction mechanics, to insulate itself from competition, and force advertisers and publishers to use its tools,” said Attorney General Merrick Garland at a press conference announcing the lawsuit.”Warning: Do not “other” me because of my age. “But I hate this new attention lavished on aging. Why? Because it “others” me. It puts me in a separate category from the rest of the world, and that is not how I think, feel, act, or want to be seen. All of a sudden I am not smart, pretty, successful, talented, or part of the family. I am “old.” I am somebody’s responsibility. I have to be told when to stop driving, and my checkbook can be taken away. I am a candidate for Senior Living (banishment to a place full of other old people).”Tapbot shuts down Tweetbot as it pivots to Mastodon. “Now that Twitter has confirmed it’s banning third-party clients, some of the most prominent alternatives are going away. Tapbots has shut down work on Tweetbot, one of the more popular iOS apps, as Twitter rendered it non-functional “in a blink of an eye.” The developer is instead pivoting to Ivory, an app for the open social platform Mastodon. While it’s limited to an invitation-only test for now, Tapbots hopes to make the software “better than Tweetbot ever could be.”” Likewise, Mastodon will be better than Twitter ever could be.U.S. No Fly List Left on Unprotected Airline Server. “Analysis of the server resulted in the discovery of a text file named “NoFly.csv,” a reference to the subset of individuals in the Terrorist Screening Database who have been barred from air travel due to having suspected or known ties to terrorist organizations.”‘Passion economy’ platforms cut costs in tech downturn. ““People are making choices,” said Rebecca McGrath, an internet analyst at Mintel. “Unless you’re very loyal to a creator, that’ll be one of the obvious things to drop.””Tesla video promoting self-driving was staged, engineer testifies. “A 2016 video that Tesla used to promote its self-driving technology was staged to show capabilities like stopping at a red light and accelerating at a green light that the system did not have, according to testimony by a senior engineer.” They’re fun cars to drive, but don’t let them drive themselves.Medium embraces Mastodon. “Today, Medium is launching a Mastodon instance at http://me.dm/ to help our authors, publications and readers find a home in the fediverse. Mastodon is an emerging force for good in social media and we are excited to join this community.” Hell yeah.The Effects of Online Content Moderation: Evidence from President Trump's Account Deletion. “The toxicity of tweets sent by Trump followers relative to a representative sample of US Twitter users dropped by around 25% after the account deletion. Second, this effect is larger for pro-Trump tweets and Republican users. Third, Trump’s suspension reduced the total number of tweets, suggesting a drop in engagement. Fourth, we find effects on individuals who did not follow Trump directly but followed somebody that did, suggesting network spillovers.”The Intercept Obtains Surveillance Footage of Tesla Crash on Bay Bridge. “These semi-autonomous systems are playing the same sort of trick as ChatGPT: they offer a convincing but shallow impression of a competent driverless car without any broader context to fall back on.”Apache® Appropriation. “We urge The Apache® Software Foundation to take the necessary steps needed to express the ally-ship they promote so deeply on their website, to act in accordance with their own code of conduct, to “be careful in the words that [they] choose”, and change their name.” +1.San Francisco Police Are Using Driverless Cars as Mobile Surveillance Cameras. “Law enforcement agencies already have access to automated license plate readers, geofence warrants, Ring Doorbell footage, as well as the ability to purchase location data. This practice will extend the reach of an already pervasive web of surveillance.”Seattle schools sue tech giants over social media harm. “[The lawsuit] blames [social media giants] for worsening mental health and behavioral disorders including anxiety, depression, disordered eating and cyberbullying; making it more difficult to educate students; and forcing schools to take steps such as hiring additional mental health professionals, developing lesson plans about the effects of social media, and providing additional training to teachers.”‘Office Space’ Inspired Engineer’s Theft Scheme, Police Say. “A software engineer siphoned more than $300,000 from his employer by introducing what prosecutors called a “series of malicious software edits” that wired money into his personal account. If the scheme sounds like the plot of “Office Space,” that’s because the authorities said it was partly inspired by the movie.”Activity Streams graphical model. “So I did a bit of drawing just to make it clearer (for myself) what kind of data can be shipped around in the Fediverse. To be clear, this is only a small part of the overall stack, but an important one.” Useful work!TwitterElon Musk’s Twitter hit with holocaust denial hate speech lawsuit in Germany. “Current studies prove that 84% of posts containing antisemitic hate speech were not reviewed by social media platforms, as shown in a study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate. Which means that Twitter knows Jews are being publicly attacked on the platform every day and that antisemitism is becoming a normality in our society. And that the platform’s response is by no means adequate.”Daring Fireball: If You Needed Any More Confirmation, Internal Slack Messages at Twitter Show That Cutting Off Third-Party Clients Was 'Intentional'. “Twitter can of course do what it wants, and Musk owns Twitter so he can do what he wants. But pulling the plug on these clients and ghosting everyone on communications about it is so absurdly disrespectful. Zero respect for the users for those apps, zero respect for the developers behind them — many of whom had been building on the Twitter platform for 10-15 years. Just a clown show.”How Twitter misleads us about how many people have left — and what to do about it. “To outside observers, it can seem like Twitter users are continuing as before, seemingly unaware of the millions of people who have left. “You left Twitter?” a friend recently remarked, “I hadn’t noticed.” Yet many of the accounts I follow haven’t tweeted in ages, and roughly 15% of them have already set up accounts on Mastodon.” Some great tips in this piece."

Rather than expanding into new habits, topics and interests, I wanted to spend time exploring, finishing and working on things that I’d already started. It was a busy month!

The last Apple needs is for us to be able to purchase subscriptions in-app. We’re using the <a href=\"https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase\">cordova-purchase-plugin</a> to make that possible, and we’re almost there. This will tailor a much better reader experience using the app on mobile for the 50% of people who currently access Hardcover through a mobile device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also for <strong>Hardcover</strong>, my focus this month will be on improved reliability.

IMO he is one of the top AI engineers &amp; researchers in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So: The leading AI/ ML Engineers are now using ChatGPT for code discovery &amp; prototyping, and CoPilot for code generation, or both. Checkout: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ArjanFranzen/code-generation-comparing-openais-chatgpt-to-github-s-copilot-zen-software-a849b56029a8\">Code Generation: Comparing ChatGPT and CoPilot</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding how CoPilot and Codex (the LM behind) interpret prompts is crucial. @ParthThakkar -who is working on ML Program Synthesis- has reverse-engineered CoPilot. In <a href=\"https://thakkarparth007.github.io/copilot-explorer/posts/copilot-internals\">CoPilot Internals, he explains the secret sauce of CoPilot prompting</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>@ColinFortuner in his post: <a href=\"https://viridian-seal-43a.notion.site/AI-Coding-Checkpoints-c4d9b5b26b8141548dec8703fdfc08f9\">AI Coding Checkpoints</a> hypothesises about a really good prompt that could get ChatGPT to produce a perfect set of code and commit it to GitHub automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in October, a team @INRIA investigated the importance of <em>prompt temperature</em>and <em>prompt engineering variation</em> for obtaining coding results with 70-99% accuracy. See: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14699\">Piloting CoPilot &amp; Codex: Hot Temperature, Cold Prompts, or Black Magic?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed knowing how to write<em> good coding prompts</em> is key. The leading AI/ ML engineers are using these prompt libraries below in combination with CoPilot/Codex &amp; ChatGPT to obtain better coding results from prompting:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>OpenPrompt – <a href=\"https://thunlp.github.io/OpenPrompt/\">a PyTorch library for prompt-learning, a new paradigm</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>PromptSource – <a href=\"https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/promptsource\">a Py toolkit for creating, sharing and using prompts </a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>betterprompt – <a href=\"https://github.com/krrishdholakia/betterprompt\">a library for testing LM prompts</a></li>\n</ul><p>If you want to learn more about Prompt Engineering, this is a really great, comprehensive overview: <a href=\"https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/a-complete-introduction-to-prompt-engineering/\">A Complete Introduction to Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon, Open AI will add to ChatGPT what they call <em>Prompt Palettes,</em> which are pre-written prompts for all sort of tasks. CoPilot Labs has already added a feature called <a href=\"https://christianheilmann.com/2022/12/13/code-brushes-for-github-copilot/\">Brushes that allows you to change code to make it cleaner, more robust and document it automatically</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want some ideas on using CoPilot/Codex and ChatGPT for coding?

So brilliant!</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-labs/\">Code explanation, code translation and custom prompts </a>with CoPilot Labs</li>\n</ul><p>I know many AI/ ML engineers who are very negative, dismissive about AI Pair-Programming and Code Prompting… “<em>It’s just a fad. Plus the AI makes errors…</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01766\">Exploring the Verifiability of Code Generated by GitHub Copilot</a>, the researchers conclude that CoPilot generates verifiable code in low &amp; medium coding tasks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the point is not about the AI making errors. Sure! CoPilot makes errors; human coders make errors too. And of course, you need to be a good coder to use AI Pair-programming &amp; Code Prompting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is about AI coding superpowers, reducing coding time drastically…automating testing, documentation, bug fixing, refactoring… Becoming a code prompter and editor supported by AI, instead of just being a code writer aided by Google Search &amp; StackOverflow…</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong></strong><em><strong>I don’t even really code, I prompt &amp; edit…</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>StackOverflow has already <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/help/gpt-policy\">banned posting with ChatGPT content</a>. ICML 2023 is <a href=\"https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/llm-policy\">prohibiting the use of LLMs like ChatGPT to write academic papers</a>. The NYC Ed. Dept. has <a href=\"https://cacm.acm.org/news/268457-nyc-education-dept-blocks-chatgpt-on-school-devices-networks/fulltext\">banned ChatGPT across all NYC schools too</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess all that is futile gatekeeping. The barbarians are arriving. Eventually, AI/ ML engineers will become supervisors &amp; managers of tribes of AI programming bots.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Programming will be obsolete. I believe the conventional idea of “writing a program” is headed for extinction, and indeed, for all but very specialized applications, most software, as we know it, will be replaced by AI systems that are trained rather than programmed. </em><a href=\"https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2023/1/267976-the-end-of-programming/fulltext\">The End of Programming, Communications of the ACM Jan 2023</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>How long until then? I reckon much sooner than we expect. What do you think? I’m really iterested in your inputs and comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a nice week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>10 Link-o-Troned</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>[awesome] <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/yoavg/59d174608e92e845c8994ac2e234c8a9\">Some Remarks on Language Models</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://xcorr.net/2023/01/01/2022-in-review-neuroai-comes-of-age/\">Neuroscience + AI: neuroAI Comes of Age</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.yitay.net/blog/2022-best-nlp-papers\">A Review: Top, Interesting Language AI Papers, 2022</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest\">The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/intro-graphml\">Intro to Graph ML &amp;

IMO he is one of the top AI engineers & researchers in the world.\n\n\n\nSo: The leading AI/ ML Engineers are now using ChatGPT for code discovery & prototyping, and CoPilot for code generation, or both. Checkout: Code Generation: Comparing ChatGPT and CoPilot\n\n\n\nUnderstanding how CoPilot and Codex (the LM behind) interpret prompts is crucial. @ParthThakkar -who is working on ML Program Synthesis- has reverse-engineered CoPilot. In CoPilot Internals, he explains the secret sauce of CoPilot prompting. \n\n\n\n@ColinFortuner in his post: AI Coding Checkpoints hypothesises about a really good prompt that could get ChatGPT to produce a perfect set of code and commit it to GitHub automatically.\n\n\n\nBack in October, a team @INRIA investigated the importance of prompt temperatureand prompt engineering variation for obtaining coding results with 70-99% accuracy. See: Piloting CoPilot & Codex: Hot Temperature, Cold Prompts, or Black Magic?\n\n\n\nIndeed knowing how to write good coding prompts is key. The leading AI/ ML engineers are using these prompt libraries below in combination with CoPilot/Codex & ChatGPT to obtain better coding results from prompting:\n\n\n\nOpenPrompt – a PyTorch library for prompt-learning, a new paradigm\n\n\n\nPromptSource – a Py toolkit for creating, sharing and using prompts \n\n\n\nbetterprompt – a library for testing LM prompts\nIf you want to learn more about Prompt Engineering, this is a really great, comprehensive overview: A Complete Introduction to Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models. \n\n\n\nSoon, Open AI will add to ChatGPT what they call Prompt Palettes, which are pre-written prompts for all sort of tasks. CoPilot Labs has already added a feature called Brushes that allows you to change code to make it cleaner, more robust and document it automatically.\n\n\n\nWant some ideas on using CoPilot/Codex and ChatGPT for coding? Here are a few:\n\n\n\nHow to Prompt Open AI Codex to Produce the Code you Want\n\n\n\n11 Ways you Can Use ChatGPT to Write Code\n\n\n\nUsing CoPilot for ML Engineering\n\n\n\nIntroducing Infinite AI Array to ChatGPT for solving typical Python issues on lists, dictionaries and types. So brilliant!\n\n\n\nCode explanation, code translation and custom prompts with CoPilot Labs\nI know many AI/ ML engineers who are very negative, dismissive about AI Pair-Programming and Code Prompting… “It’s just a fad. Plus the AI makes errors…”\n\n\n\nIn Exploring the Verifiability of Code Generated by GitHub Copilot, the researchers conclude that CoPilot generates verifiable code in low & medium coding tasks. \n\n\n\nBut the point is not about the AI making errors. Sure! CoPilot makes errors; human coders make errors too. And of course, you need to be a good coder to use AI Pair-programming & Code Prompting. \n\n\n\nThe point is about AI coding superpowers, reducing coding time drastically…automating testing, documentation, bug fixing, refactoring… Becoming a code prompter and editor supported by AI, instead of just being a code writer aided by Google Search & StackOverflow…\n\n\n\n\nI don’t even really code, I prompt & edit…\n\n\n\n\nStackOverflow has already banned posting with ChatGPT content. ICML 2023 is prohibiting the use of LLMs like ChatGPT to write academic papers. The NYC Ed. Dept. has banned ChatGPT across all NYC schools too. \n\n\n\nI guess all that is futile gatekeeping. The barbarians are arriving. Eventually, AI/ ML engineers will become supervisors & managers of tribes of AI programming bots.\n\n\n\n\nProgramming will be obsolete. I believe the conventional idea of “writing a program” is headed for extinction, and indeed, for all but very specialized applications, most software, as we know it, will be replaced by AI systems that are trained rather than programmed. The End of Programming, Communications of the ACM Jan 2023\n\n\n\n\nHow long until then? I reckon much sooner than we expect. What do you think? I’m really iterested in your inputs and comments.\n\n\n\nHave a nice week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Link-o-Troned\n\n\n\n[awesome] Some Remarks on Language Models\n\n\n\nNeuroscience + AI: neuroAI Comes of Age\n\n\n\nA Review: Top, Interesting Language AI Papers, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI\n\n\n\nIntro to Graph ML & Graph Transformers\n\n\n\n Open Assistant: An Open Source Chat Language Model\n\n\n\nAI for Game Dev: Creating a Farming Game in 5 Days\n\n\n\nweb-transformers: Run Transformers in the Browser\n\n\n\nA Guide to Building an Open Source Neural Search Engine\n\n\n\n[Free] Harvard AI Research Experiences – The Course Book\n\n\n\nAll Things AI- A Complete Resource of AI Tools & Apps, 2023\nShare Data Machina with friends\n\n\n\nthe ML Pythonista\n\n\n\nTutorial: Object Detection with Facebook DETR Transformer\n\n\n\nHow-to: Build a Neural Collab-Filtering RecSys in Tensorflow\n\n\n\nNeuralFit – An Easier Way to Complex Neuro Evolutionary Nets\nthe ML codeR\n\n\n\ngpttools – Easily Incorporate ChatGPT in your ML Workflow\n\n\n\nMLOps: The Whole Game\n\n\n\nCausal Discovery in Heavy-tailed Models \nDeep & Other Learning Bits\n\n\n\nGraph Neural Nets: A Study Guide\n\n\n\nIntro to RL with Human Feedback (RLHF): From Zero to chatGPT\n\n\n\nA Survey of In-Context Learning\nAI/ ML ResearchDocs\n\n\n\nGoogle Muse: SoTA Text-to-Image Generation (Jan 2023)\n\n\n\nMS Research VALL-E: SoTA Text-to-Speech (Jan 2023)\n\n\n\nDiffusion-GAN: Training GANs with Diffusion\nEl Robótico\n\n\n\nMini Cheetah Clone Quadruped Teardown\n\n\n\nTesting Robotic Shoes, Walk 250% Faster\n\n\n\nThe Most Realistic, Diverse Autonomous Driving Simulator\ndata v-i-s-i-o-n-s\n\n\n\nManimML: Animations & Viz of Common ML Concepts\n\n\n\nThe List of 2022 Best Dataviz Lists\n\n\n\nFrom Data to Viz: A Decision Tree\nDataEng Wranglings\n\n\n\nStop Using Airflow for Data Science\n\n\n\nClickhouse Local – A Small Serverless SQL Tool for Data Engineers\n\n\n\nA Data Catalog for Data Engineers Who Hate Data Catalogs\nAI startups -> radar\n\n\n\nDetangle – AI for Legal Docs Summarisation\n\n\n\nPrecision Neuro – Next Generation Neural Engineering\n\n\n\nExynAI – Autonomous Drones for Dangerous Places\nML Datasets & Stuff\n\n\n\nArgoverse 2 – Next Generation Dataset for Self-Driving\n\n\n\nSODA – 1st Public, Large-scale Dataset on Social Interactions\n\n\n\nMindBigData – THE MNIST Dataset of Brain Signals\nPostscript, etc\n\n\n\nSubmit your suggestions, feedback, posts and links to:\n\n\n\ndatamachina@datamachina.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished by Carlos  ·  Launched 4 years ago\n\n\n\nKeep up with the very latest in AI / Machine Learning research, projects & repos.

In a confusing twist of standpoint, I’m additionally going to clutch a spy at and talk myself out of them by explaining to you, dear Reader, why they are bullshit.</p><p>···</p><h2><a href=\"http://mxb.dev/#h-i-don%E2%80%99t-have-time\">#</a> I don’t believe time</h2><p>This is the massive one, upright? All of us believe assorted things to preserve up out, and writing takes time. In my case, I’ve been in actuality swamped with client initiatives and assorted work final 365 days.</p><p>I mediate when you happen to essentially desire to write down though, it’s more a lack of routine than a lack of time itself. Other folks who consistently salvage voice believe discovered to salvage a behavior out of it. I read <a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits\">“Atomic Habits”</a> by James Obvious a couple of months in the past and its message kinda caught with me. It’s about conditioning your self to preserve up out sure things more as soon as at the moment by constructing a routine.</p><p>Use 15 minutes each day forward of you take a look at your email and <a href=\"https://www.sarasoueidan.com/desk/just-write/\">honest write</a>. Or carry out it on your shuttle to work if that you just would possibly presumably perhaps additionally mediate! The trick is to employ amounts of time which shall be so small you would possibly presumably perhaps additionally’t presumably <strong>no longer</strong> match them on your time desk. It could possibly presumably no longer be ample for a completely-fledged article, but ample to salvage a behavior.</p><p>It’s additionally worth noting that your writing doesn’t constantly would possibly presumably perhaps additionally peaceful be wisely-crafted longform blogposts. It must honest be a couple of paragraphs about your solutions, linking out to assorted stuff. <a href=\"https://chriscoyier.net/\">Chris</a> does a gargantuan job at this, and others believe currently adopted <a href=\"https://nerdy.dev/\">even shorter</a> <a href=\"https://jhey.dev/\">formats</a>, mimicking social media posts in dimension.</p><h2><a href=\"http://mxb.dev/#h-i-don%E2%80%99t-have-anything-interesting-to-say\">#</a> I don’t believe anything else interesting to pronounce</h2><p>The classic impostor syndrome comes out right here. I don’t know anything else particular, so why grief?</p><p>The real fact is that <em>each person</em> has something interesting to pronounce attributable to each person faces assorted challenges. You don’t desire to head viral and salvage buzzword-riddled thinkpieces about the original hot topic – There’s ample sites who already carry out that, and <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest\">AI will at the moment salvage a shitton more of it</a>.</p><p>An even bigger opinion is to write down about what you already know and journey on your day-to-day life as a replacement. Authentic posts are constantly precious, and also you are going to solidify your believe files in the technique too.</p><p>Right here are a couple of total writing prompts and examples for blogposts I decide to read:</p><ul><li><strong>“I learnt something” (<abbr title=\"Today I learned\">TIL</abbr>)</strong><br />Michelle Barker: <a href=\"https://css-irl.info/quick-tip-negative-animation-delay/\">Negative Animation Lengthen</a></li><li><strong>“I realized something”</strong><br />Dave Rupert: <a href=\"https://daverupert.com/2023/01/shadow-banned-by-duckduckgo-and-bing/\">I’m Shadow Banned by DuckDuckGo (and Bing)</a></li><li><strong>“I constructed something”</strong><br />Lynn Fisher: <a href=\"https://lynnandtonic.com/thoughts/entries/case-study-2022-refresh/\">lynnandtonic.com Refresh</a></li><li><strong>365 days in Review</strong><br />Sophie Koonin: <a href=\"https://localghost.dev/blog/2022-the-year-in-lists/\">2022: The 365 days in lists</a></li><li><strong>Non-public Stuff!</strong><br />Cassie Evans: <a href=\"https://www.cassie.codes/posts/my-typical-day/\">My regular day</a></li></ul><h2><a href=\"http://mxb.dev/#h-i-gotta-fix-%5Bx%5D-on-my-site-first\">#</a> I gotta fix [X] on my space first</h2><p>This one is particularly standard among developers. “How can I that you just would possibly presumably perhaps additionally mediate write anything else forward of the typography is gracious? How can I ever submit anything else when webmentions are no longer utilized but?” We decide to tinker with our internet sites and that’s cold, but at some level it gets in the form of in actuality <em>the utilization of</em> your blog and rising voice.</p><p>Despite what we affirm ourselves, it in actuality doesn’t matter too noteworthy how a blog appears to be like to be or what substances it has. Other folks come for the voice, and as lengthy as they would possibly be able to read it, they’re overjoyed. Throw in an RSS feed so each person can employ their believe reader and also you’re golden. It bother me to pronounce it but <a href=\"https://front-end.social/@matuzo/109768438608948867\">Manuel is de facto upright</a> right here.</p><p>And if he would possibly presumably perhaps additionally additionally be “redesigning in the originate” for three years while churning out huge amounts of CSS files, your space shall be swish too. 😉</p><h2><a href=\"http://mxb.dev/#h-others-have-already-written-about-this\">#</a> Others believe already written about this</h2><p>In most cases I’ve got a gargantuan thought for a submit, but an initial Google search finds that somebody else already beat me to it. The novelty has used off and that assorted submit is a lot better than what I would possibly presumably perhaps additionally believe give you anyway, I affirm myself.</p><p>That’s no longer a exact reason pointless to hiss, no one has a monopoly on a topic. Others would possibly presumably perhaps additionally believe already lined the topic – but no longer on your direct, no longer from your standpoint. Probabilities are you’ll presumably perhaps presumably additionally write a submit about the exact similar part and peaceful present precious files the assorted author has missed. Otherwise you would possibly presumably perhaps additionally formula the topic from a assorted angle, for a assorted skill-level or for a assorted viewers.</p><p>Any other draw is to read the cloth that is already accessible and clutch notes about your total questions you continue to believe afterwards. Strive to in spite of all the pieces carry out the part (write the code, employ the app, no matter) and seek for what assorted files would believe been precious for you to believe. Write that!</p><h2><a href=\"http://mxb.dev/#h-the-moment-for-this-has-passed\">#</a> The second for this has passed</h2><p>There are writing solutions which shall be impressed by some match or dialog. Perhaps something huge took space on the ranking or I’ve had an extraordinarily interesting discussion on social media. So I sketch out a short outline for a submit and stick it in my <code>drafts</code> folder, thinking I’ll bag help to it later.</p><p>Three weeks cross and that lonely draft sits around gathering dust, and by the time I undergo in solutions it, the second has passed. The dialog has moved on, and so the submit is abandoned and at final deleted.</p><p>The ranking strikes rather rapidly and there’s constantly a “hot topic of the day”, but that doesn’t imply that no-one is attracted to anything else. A gracious looking out part about blogs is that they’re asynchronous. Probabilities are you’ll presumably perhaps presumably additionally honest write things and keep them accessible, and even supposing they don’t hit a nerve straight, folks can take into legend them of their believe time.</p><p>Older posts can additionally bag re-stumbled on years later and bag a second wind, no longer to tag that americans consistently peek for particular things – and your submit shall be honest what they’re attempting to collect then! Some of my veteran posts about <a href=\"http://mxb.dev/blog/webring-kit/\">webrings</a> and the IndieWeb believe currently stumbled on readers as soon as more since Twitter has started going on the drain. You by no draw know!</p><h2><a href=\"http://mxb.dev/#h-i-can%E2%80%99t-get-it-to-sound-right\">#</a> I will’t bag it to sound upright</h2><p>A couple of the (tech) blogs I read are in English, even supposing its authors are from all the draw thru the arena. For a non-native english speaker fancy myself, it could well as soon as at the moment be ambitious to write down in a international language. It is a ways a barrier in phrases of manufacturing “polished” text – there’s additional brain cycles occupied with getting your solutions to “sound” upright.</p><p>This is in a position to presumably additionally very wisely be no longer an infinite deal though. Other folks don’t anticipate to read world-class literature as soon as they come to study out a blogpost about “Lobster Mode”. As lengthy as you would possibly presumably perhaps additionally bag your level all the draw thru, it’s swish when you happen to don’t employ esteem phrases. It must additionally be an benefit: for a world viewers, easy English would possibly presumably perhaps additionally even be more uncomplicated to raise finish.</p><p>That being mentioned, that is a usecase the establish AI would possibly presumably perhaps additionally in actuality be precious! While <abbr title=\"Large Language Models\">LLMs</abbr> fancy GPT-3 and co are <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2023/01/28/decoding-the-hype-about-ai\">ineffective at rising exact voice</a> or usual solutions, they’re gargantuan at making sentences sound constructive. Instruments fancy <a href=\"https://www.jasper.ai/\">Jasper</a> can rewrite your reproduction and beef up the tone with out changing the contained files. Form of fancy <a href=\"https://prettier.io/\">prettier</a> but for English prose.</p><h2><a href=\"http://mxb.dev/#h-nobody%E2%80%99s-going-to-read-it-anyway\">#</a> Nobody’s going to read it anyway</h2><p>Let’s be correct: no one likes to yowl into the void. Every person wants their voice to be considered, and social validation is the candy candy dopamine reward we all crave.</p><p>There’s nothing unfavorable with sharing your work on social media or standard orange link aggregators either, but as soon as at the moment there honest gained’t be noteworthy of a reaction after you submit. That would possibly presumably feel stressful – but in the extinguish I mediate obesessing over conceitedness metrics is no longer worth it anyway. Just attributable to something doesn’t salvage the frontpage of Reddit does no longer imply it’s no longer precious.</p><p>Don’t underestimate how many americans actively read deepest blogs though! The ranking dev community is particularly eager by RSS, and with the Fediverse gaining more and more recognition, usual voice on your believe enviornment has a seriously better attain now than forward of.</p><blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Who’s gonna read your deepest blog attributable to it has an RSS feed?

        "text": "I in actuality believe currently been made conscious that the frequency of contemporary voice published on my space has long gone down slightly a small bit.Good ample swish, I trash-talked Manuel’s internet space on Mastodon and he accurately identified that while I wrote a ambitious two (2) blogposts final 365 days, he wrote around 90 (while additionally doing talks, audits, elevating an small one daughter and doubtlessly coaching for a marathon or some shit fancy that, I imply let’s face it the man is annoyingly productive).I do know I was slacking off a small bit and those numbers talk for themselves. While I as soon as at the moment desire to write down, solutions continuously salvage it your total approach to a broadcast submit.Love many others, “write more” is excessive up on my imaginary list of life enhancements and though I don’t as soon as at the moment carry out contemporary 365 days’s resolutions, now feels fancy a gracious time to re-review what’s stopping me there.I got right here up with seven reasons that I employ to define why I’m no longer writing. In a confusing twist of standpoint, I’m additionally going to clutch a spy at and talk myself out of them by explaining to you, dear Reader, why they are bullshit.···# I don’t believe timeThis is the massive one, upright? All of us believe assorted things to preserve up out, and writing takes time. In my case, I’ve been in actuality swamped with client initiatives and assorted work final 365 days.I mediate when you happen to essentially desire to write down though, it’s more a lack of routine than a lack of time itself. Other folks who consistently salvage voice believe discovered to salvage a behavior out of it. I read “Atomic Habits” by James Obvious a couple of months in the past and its message kinda caught with me. It’s about conditioning your self to preserve up out sure things more as soon as at the moment by constructing a routine.Use 15 minutes each day forward of you take a look at your email and honest write. Or carry out it on your shuttle to work if that you just would possibly presumably perhaps additionally mediate! The trick is to employ amounts of time which shall be so small you would possibly presumably perhaps additionally’t presumably no longer match them on your time desk. It could possibly presumably no longer be ample for a completely-fledged article, but ample to salvage a behavior.It’s additionally worth noting that your writing doesn’t constantly would possibly presumably perhaps additionally peaceful be wisely-crafted longform blogposts. It must honest be a couple of paragraphs about your solutions, linking out to assorted stuff. Chris does a gargantuan job at this, and others believe currently adopted even shorter formats, mimicking social media posts in dimension.# I don’t believe anything else interesting to pronounceThe classic impostor syndrome comes out right here. I don’t know anything else particular, so why grief?The real fact is that each person has something interesting to pronounce attributable to each person faces assorted challenges. You don’t desire to head viral and salvage buzzword-riddled thinkpieces about the original hot topic – There’s ample sites who already carry out that, and AI will at the moment salvage a shitton more of it.An even bigger opinion is to write down about what you already know and journey on your day-to-day life as a replacement. Authentic posts are constantly precious, and also you are going to solidify your believe files in the technique too.Right here are a couple of total writing prompts and examples for blogposts I decide to read:“I learnt something” (TIL)\nMichelle Barker: Negative Animation Lengthen“I realized something”\nDave Rupert: I’m Shadow Banned by DuckDuckGo (and Bing)“I constructed something”\nLynn Fisher: lynnandtonic.com Refresh365 days in Review\nSophie Koonin: 2022: The 365 days in listsNon-public Stuff!\nCassie Evans: My regular day# I gotta fix [X] on my space firstThis one is particularly standard among developers. “How can I that you just would possibly presumably perhaps additionally mediate write anything else forward of the typography is gracious? How can I ever submit anything else when webmentions are no longer utilized but?” We decide to tinker with our internet sites and that’s cold, but at some level it gets in the form of in actuality the utilization of your blog and rising voice.Despite what we affirm ourselves, it in actuality doesn’t matter too noteworthy how a blog appears to be like to be or what substances it has. Other folks come for the voice, and as lengthy as they would possibly be able to read it, they’re overjoyed. Throw in an RSS feed so each person can employ their believe reader and also you’re golden. It bother me to pronounce it but Manuel is de facto upright right here.And if he would possibly presumably perhaps additionally additionally be “redesigning in the originate” for three years while churning out huge amounts of CSS files, your space shall be swish too. 😉# Others believe already written about thisIn most cases I’ve got a gargantuan thought for a submit, but an initial Google search finds that somebody else already beat me to it. The novelty has used off and that assorted submit is a lot better than what I would possibly presumably perhaps additionally believe give you anyway, I affirm myself.That’s no longer a exact reason pointless to hiss, no one has a monopoly on a topic. Others would possibly presumably perhaps additionally believe already lined the topic – but no longer on your direct, no longer from your standpoint. Probabilities are you’ll presumably perhaps presumably additionally write a submit about the exact similar part and peaceful present precious files the assorted author has missed. Otherwise you would possibly presumably perhaps additionally formula the topic from a assorted angle, for a assorted skill-level or for a assorted viewers.Any other draw is to read the cloth that is already accessible and clutch notes about your total questions you continue to believe afterwards. Strive to in spite of all the pieces carry out the part (write the code, employ the app, no matter) and seek for what assorted files would believe been precious for you to believe. Write that!# The second for this has passedThere are writing solutions which shall be impressed by some match or dialog. Perhaps something huge took space on the ranking or I’ve had an extraordinarily interesting discussion on social media. So I sketch out a short outline for a submit and stick it in my drafts folder, thinking I’ll bag help to it later.Three weeks cross and that lonely draft sits around gathering dust, and by the time I undergo in solutions it, the second has passed. The dialog has moved on, and so the submit is abandoned and at final deleted.The ranking strikes rather rapidly and there’s constantly a “hot topic of the day”, but that doesn’t imply that no-one is attracted to anything else. A gracious looking out part about blogs is that they’re asynchronous. Probabilities are you’ll presumably perhaps presumably additionally honest write things and keep them accessible, and even supposing they don’t hit a nerve straight, folks can take into legend them of their believe time.Older posts can additionally bag re-stumbled on years later and bag a second wind, no longer to tag that americans consistently peek for particular things – and your submit shall be honest what they’re attempting to collect then! Some of my veteran posts about webrings and the IndieWeb believe currently stumbled on readers as soon as more since Twitter has started going on the drain. You by no draw know!# I will’t bag it to sound uprightA couple of the (tech) blogs I read are in English, even supposing its authors are from all the draw thru the arena. For a non-native english speaker fancy myself, it could well as soon as at the moment be ambitious to write down in a international language. It is a ways a barrier in phrases of manufacturing “polished” text – there’s additional brain cycles occupied with getting your solutions to “sound” upright.This is in a position to presumably additionally very wisely be no longer an infinite deal though. Other folks don’t anticipate to read world-class literature as soon as they come to study out a blogpost about “Lobster Mode”. As lengthy as you would possibly presumably perhaps additionally bag your level all the draw thru, it’s swish when you happen to don’t employ esteem phrases. It must additionally be an benefit: for a world viewers, easy English would possibly presumably perhaps additionally even be more uncomplicated to raise finish.That being mentioned, that is a usecase the establish AI would possibly presumably perhaps additionally in actuality be precious! While LLMs fancy GPT-3 and co are ineffective at rising exact voice or usual solutions, they’re gargantuan at making sentences sound constructive. Instruments fancy Jasper can rewrite your reproduction and beef up the tone with out changing the contained files. Form of fancy prettier but for English prose.# Nobody’s going to read it anywayLet’s be correct: no one likes to yowl into the void. Every person wants their voice to be considered, and social validation is the candy candy dopamine reward we all crave.There’s nothing unfavorable with sharing your work on social media or standard orange link aggregators either, but as soon as at the moment there honest gained’t be noteworthy of a reaction after you submit. That would possibly presumably feel stressful – but in the extinguish I mediate obesessing over conceitedness metrics is no longer worth it anyway. Just attributable to something doesn’t salvage the frontpage of Reddit does no longer imply it’s no longer precious.Don’t underestimate how many americans actively read deepest blogs though! The ranking dev community is particularly eager by RSS, and with the Fediverse gaining more and more recognition, usual voice on your believe enviornment has a seriously better attain now than forward of.Who’s gonna read your deepest blog attributable to it has an RSS feed? I’m gonna read your deepest blog attributable to it has an RSS feed. pic.twitter.com/mtcyKhEVet— Chris Coyier (@chriscoyier) January 7, 2020···Correct, I perceive it’s a small bit uncommon to write down a submit about how I don’t write posts. However I’m hoping to push help on this in 2023 and gather more time for writing. I additionally suspect that assorted folks believe identical reasons and perhaps talking about them helps a small bit.Despite all the pieces, that’s one more submit in the monetary institution!Read More💦Continue ReadingPrevious: Glovo lays off 6% of personnel following original swish from Spanish executiveNext: Unique Distro ‘BlendOS’ Combines Arch Linux, Fedora Linux and Ubuntu"

Because honestly… why is everyone so afraid to write their own articles or hire someone to draw images?Related"

        "html": "<p>Digital gardens are reminiscent of the personal websites of the 90s before social media changed the entire landscape. They are places where individuals publish information on their personal interests. According to the ethos of the Digital Garden <strong>dense links</strong> are essential. Rather than browse a garden chronologically like you would a blog, you can enter into a garden anywhere and follow a different path each time you visit.</p>\n<p>Gardens are also <strong>continuously growing and evolving</strong> along with the gardener. There tend to be three types of content in a garden. These classifications also indicate to your readers how complete the information they’re reading is. These are the categories I prefer, others use slightly different classifications such as seeds, buds, and evergreen.</p>\n<ul><li>🌱 <strong>Seedlings</strong> are the beginning of ideas. <strong>Notes</strong> on a new interest that you know very little about at the moment. A traditional blogger would never publish a rudimentary note to their blog. Many of these notes will eventually be pruned or worked into other ideas. Some of them will develop into trees.</li>\n<li>🌳 <strong>Trees</strong> are ideas that have begun to grow and mature. You’ve learned quite a bit more about the topic and definitely want to learn more. You’re not quite ready to teach the topic yet but you have at least an intermediate knowledge. Many trees will remain trees as you realize you know all you wish to know about the topic. You’ve taken the idea as far as you wish to take it. Other trees will eventually flower.</li>\n<li>🌺 <strong>Flowers</strong> are the culmination of your idea. You’ve researched, you’ve summarized, you’ve done a ton of critical thinking, you’ve written your own ideas, you know enough to teach someone and you probably have to some degree. This usually culminates into an <strong>evergreen</strong> article, a course, or a book.

        "text": "Digital gardens are reminiscent of the personal websites of the 90s before social media changed the entire landscape. They are places where individuals publish information on their personal interests. According to the ethos of the Digital Garden dense links are essential. Rather than browse a garden chronologically like you would a blog, you can enter into a garden anywhere and follow a different path each time you visit.\nGardens are also continuously growing and evolving along with the gardener. There tend to be three types of content in a garden. These classifications also indicate to your readers how complete the information they’re reading is. These are the categories I prefer, others use slightly different classifications such as seeds, buds, and evergreen.\n🌱 Seedlings are the beginning of ideas. Notes on a new interest that you know very little about at the moment. A traditional blogger would never publish a rudimentary note to their blog. Many of these notes will eventually be pruned or worked into other ideas. Some of them will develop into trees.\n🌳 Trees are ideas that have begun to grow and mature. You’ve learned quite a bit more about the topic and definitely want to learn more. You’re not quite ready to teach the topic yet but you have at least an intermediate knowledge. Many trees will remain trees as you realize you know all you wish to know about the topic. You’ve taken the idea as far as you wish to take it. Other trees will eventually flower.\n🌺 Flowers are the culmination of your idea. You’ve researched, you’ve summarized, you’ve done a ton of critical thinking, you’ve written your own ideas, you know enough to teach someone and you probably have to some degree. This usually culminates into an evergreen article, a course, or a book. These are the fruits of your labor and passion.\nA traditional blogger would only publish flowers and do everything else in private, before they hit the publish button. Gardeners follow the learn in public ethos and do each step from initial idea to eventual flowering completely in public. This creates a collaborative process where your readers can give their input on your idea and correct any mistakes you may have in your logic.\nThe dark forest and the cozy web are terms coined by Venkatesh Rao.

It seemed like the perfect Christmas miracle. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/30/andrew-tate-detained-romania-brothers-crime/\">But wasn't true after all</a>. Still, Tate faces prosecution in Romania after fleeing to Romania because he thought he won’t be prosecuted there.</p><p><a href=\"https://mastodon.se/@osiris/109597375879403687\">Never forget</a> and welcome 2023. Behave yours… ah, well, too late.</p><h2>Lützerath</h2><p>On Wednesday, Germany decided to fuck around and find out. The fucking around is the goal to limit global warming to 1,5 degree Celsius. Cops from almost all states converged on the squatted village Lützerath in North-Rhine Westphalia.</p><p>The village lies adjacent to <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagebau_Garzweiler\">Garzweiler</a>, a gargantuan, dystopian coal mine. Enough coal to emit around 280 million tonnes of CO2 when burned.</p><p>And that’s the problem. By giving the energy company RWE permission to mine and burn the coal, <a href=\"https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.819609.de/diwkompakt_2021-169.pdf\">Germany will certainly not be able to meet the 1.5 degree target</a>. As if that wasn’t already highly unlikely.</p><p>All of this could have been prevented, it’s <a href=\"https://background.tagesspiegel.de/energie-klima/luetzerath-muss-nicht-zerstoert-werden\">not even like Germany needs the coal for anything other than RWE’s profits</a>. But here we are.</p><p>The Greens from the local to federal level transformed into RWE’s PR department, parroting claims that the coal is indeed needed. A «deal» to speed up the coal phase-out, which at the same time allows burning even more coal in the shorter timeframe serves as the fig leave. It took the Greens – almost to the day – 32 years to successfully end their march through the institutions: By becoming the institution and betraying everything they stood for.</p><p>Luisa Neubauer und Pauline Brünger wrote <a href=\"https://taz.de/Fridays-for-Future-ueber-Luetzerath/!5903446/\">a commentary for the German newspaper taz</a>, succinctly describing the dire situation we are in. <a href=\"https://www.medico.de/was-ist-eigentlich-legitim-18942\">The consequences of which will be felt worldwide</a>.</p><img height=\"1200\" width=\"1200\" src=\"https://www.ovl.design/img/fXsMyadsFx-790.jpeg\" alt=\"&quot;A spookily lit picture of a group of riot cops, helms, shields and all, standing in front of a gigantic bucket excavator.&quot;\" />German climate policy (Symbolic image), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carla_hinrichs_/status/1612741256915853312/photo/1\">photo by Carla Hinrichs</a><p>On Wednesday, January 11th, police moved in and started the eviction.</p><p>On Saturday, January 14th, tens of thousands of protesters travelled to Lützerath to support those activists remaining in the village.</p><p>The police <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qjqjd-xJ2tE?t=109\">promised</a> «unpleasant images if protesters try to break through to Lützerath».</p><p>The day ended with <a href=\"https://archive.ph/AdD0E\">several serious injuries</a>, one protester was hospitalised with life-threatening injuries. In one case, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LuetziBleibt/status/1614364552178634752\">police officers continued to beat an injured person despite ongoing treatment by the paramedics</a>. Iza Hoffmann, a paramedic, described the actions of the police as «<a href=\"https://twitter.com/izahofmann_/status/1614363893937340417\">fear and terror</a>». Journalists say they were <a href=\"https://netzpolitik.org/2023/klimaproteste-schikanen-und-uebergriffe-gegen-presse-in-luetzeraths\">assaulted by the police and obstructed in their reporting</a>.</p><p>One thing is abundantly clear: Every cop showing up to work – work being hitting the heads of protesters – does so by choice. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dzienus/status/1614265103758643202\">They choose violence</a>. The only good cop is a cop that quits their job.</p><p>At the time of writing this newsletter, according to the police, the eviction has finished, with all activists but two hiding in a tunnel removed from the village. <a href=\"https://www.ende-gelaende.org/news/luetzerath-unraeumbar/\">Ende Gelände mobilises for a return to Lützerath on January, 17th</a>.</p><p>And that’s the situation we’ll have to deal with. Cops won’t quit their job. Politicians will use climate change only to garner some votes in the next election. RWE will excavate the coal. Germany will miss its climate targets.</p><p>Activists will continue to give them hell. There’s no other way out.</p><p>To end on a lighter note, cops stuck in mud and trolled by a protester in a monk’s costume is, simply, the best.

Which makes January the official Storm a Parliament Month. I wonder which one is next.</p><p>It’s easy to categorise these events as just another version of January, 6th. But that’s too simple. For one, storming the parliament <a href=\"https://www.rnd.de/politik/sorgen-wurden-wahr-corona-demo-mit-sturm-auf-den-reichstag-QF6VWMMHHJA7ZPXRNG4KORCKWA.html\">has been attempted in Germany before</a>. Didn’t happen in January, though, and was stopped by a total of two police officers.</p><p>And, as Ryan Broderick argues in Garbage Day, the <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/on-the-cutting-edge-of-insurrectionist\">Brazilian version isn’t a reenactment, it’s an escalation</a>.</p><p>Also, unlike after the storm on the capitol, Brazilian police was able to detain 1,000 would be insurrectionists.</p><h2>This ain’t intelligence</h2><p>Maggie Appleton wrote an amazing <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest\">essay on proving you're a human on a web flooded with generative <abbr title=\"Artificial Intelligence\">AI</abbr> content</a>.</p><p>Issue number 200 of Last Week in <abbr title=\"Artificial Intelligence\">AI</abbr> <a href=\"https://lastweekin.ai/p/200\">provides a look back at 2022</a>. The year was rich with break-throughs (DALL-E 2 was released only in April) and of course a lot of <abbr title=\"Artificial Intelligence\">AI</abbr> hype theatre. Luckily, Emily M. Bender and Alex Hanna <a href=\"https://videos.trom.tf/w/p/4gykGcMrmHHs7bG2Y6qK9W\">made a show out of it</a> and pushed back on some of the more common (and outlandish) claims.</p><p>Meanwhile, we have ChatGPT running around the hype theatre.</p><p>Seemingly everybody uses it for everything, but in reality, it’s incredibly hard to know whether the information spouted by the model is true or not. Eva Wolfangel took a <a href=\"https://www.spektrum.de/news/maschinelles-lernen-chatgpt-wird-immer-plappern/2090727\">closer look at this in German science magazine Spektrum</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Wenn ChatGPT also noch so intelligent wirkt, machen wir uns klar: Das ist eine Täuschung. Das System nutzt unsere kognitive Schwäche aus, die Sprachgewandtheit mit Intelligenz in Verbindung bringt.</p></blockquote><p>Keep in mind that Microsoft has exclusive usage rights for everything OpenAI publishes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/05/microsoft-chatgpt-bing-search-engine\">Bing will implement ChatGPT</a>. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/technology/ai-chatgpt-google-search.html\">Google declared a Code Red over ChatGPT’s popularity</a>, acknowledging publicly the danger such models can persist to the business models of IT companies.</p><p>The implementation of Large Language Models as each interfaces face problems, though. First, as Emily Bender and Chirag Shah argue in <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3498366.3505816\">Situating Search</a>, LLMs can not present information in a way that allows the searcher to know where it comes from, and hence if the source is reliable or not – or if it exists at all.</p><p>The other problem, how do you make money out of it? A search with ChatGPT is estimated to cost a cent. This quickly adds up if you take Bing’s size into account.</p><p>Episode 221 of This Machine Kills <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/premium-221-from-76715102\">discusses the political economy behind these models</a>. In the end, all models are a way to make money, and 2023 will be the year when we see the ways to make money.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/01/09/1147549845/gptzero-ai-chatgpt-edward-tian-plagiarism\">GPTZero is a tool designed to detect the output of ChatGPT</a> based on linguistic properties. <a href=\"https://openai-openai-detector.hf.space/\">Hugging Face developed a similar tool for GPT-2</a>, which seems to work for ChatGPT, too.</p><p>This kind of tools <a href=\"https://ideophone.org/monetizing-uninformation-a-prediction/\">might be a future revenue stream for OpenAI and their ilk</a>.</p><blockquote><p>But the second reason is to enable a new form of monetization. Flood the zone with bullshit (or facilitate others doing so), then offer paid services to detect said bullshit. (I use bullshit as a technical term for text produced without commitment to truth values; see Frankfurt 2009.) It’s guaranteed to work because as I wrote, the market forces are in place and they will be relentless.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/opwnai-cybercriminals-starting-to-use-chatgpt/\">Cybercriminals start using ChatGPT</a>. Because why wouldn't they.</p><p>Want to use ChatGPT, but are an open-source type of person? <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/30/theres-now-an-open-source-alternative-to-chatgpt-but-good-luck-running-it/\">There’s now an open-source alternative to ChatGPT, but good luck running it</a>.</p><p>David Holz, founder of Midjourney, admitted that <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2022/12/21/midjourny-founder-admits-to-using-a-hundred-million-images-without-consent/\">there’s no way to train a model searching proper consent beforehand</a>.</p><p>The Washington Post created a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2022/ai-image-generator/\">visual explainer of the process behind generative <abbr title=\"Artificial Intelligence\">AI</abbr> models</a> such as <span>DALL-E</span> or Stable Diffusion.</p><p>Following GitHub, Stability <abbr title=\"Artificial Intelligence\">AI</abbr>, makers of Stable Diffusion, is now <a href=\"https://stablediffusionlitigation.com/\">sued over their use of copyrighted content</a>.

Well done.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/china-a-pioneer-in-regulating-algorithms-turns-its-focus-to-deepfakes-11673149283\">China now enforces its <abbr title=\"Artificial Intelligence\">AI</abbr> legislation</a>, meaning the output of generative <abbr title=\"Artificial Intelligence\">AI</abbr> has to be clearly labeled, and is not allowed to be used to produce deep fakes.</p><p><a href=\"https://mpost.io/vall-e-microsofts-new-zero-shot-text-to-speech-model-can-duplicate-everyones-voice-in-three-seconds/\">Microsoft announced VALL-E</a>, a speech synthesiser <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/\">which only needs three seconds of input to duplicate a person’s voice</a>.

So yeah, perfect. Here’s an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=OcUfXLza9hI\"> interview with Markus Beckedahl explaining the misery from a journalistic perspective</a>. And here <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlL4xvn6xWE\">Some More News on Musk and free speech</a>.</p><p>Musk’s takeover <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2023/jan/08/elon-musk-drove-more-than-a-million-people-to-mastodon-but-many-arent-sticking-around\">drove more than a million people to Mastodon – but many aren’t sticking around</a>. Mastodon’s user numbers still are higher than before the takeover.</p><p>TikTok has been accused of <a href=\"https://counterhate.com/research/deadly-by-design/\">pushing content promoting eating disorders and self-harm in the feeds of teenagers</a>.</p><p>TikTok’s success has often been attributed (including by me) to its algorithm. The truth might be slightly different.

        "text": "Police violence for fossil future, stochastic parrots doing cybercrime, TikTok’s secret, Tesla’s magic, and why peer review failed.Welcome to Around the Web.For a brief moment, it seemed like Greta Thunberg managed to slam dunk Andrew Tate into jail. It seemed like the perfect Christmas miracle. But wasn't true after all. Still, Tate faces prosecution in Romania after fleeing to Romania because he thought he won’t be prosecuted there.Never forget and welcome 2023. Behave yours… ah, well, too late.LützerathOn Wednesday, Germany decided to fuck around and find out. The fucking around is the goal to limit global warming to 1,5 degree Celsius. Cops from almost all states converged on the squatted village Lützerath in North-Rhine Westphalia.The village lies adjacent to Garzweiler, a gargantuan, dystopian coal mine. Enough coal to emit around 280 million tonnes of CO2 when burned.And that’s the problem. By giving the energy company RWE permission to mine and burn the coal, Germany will certainly not be able to meet the 1.5 degree target. As if that wasn’t already highly unlikely.All of this could have been prevented, it’s not even like Germany needs the coal for anything other than RWE’s profits. But here we are.The Greens from the local to federal level transformed into RWE’s PR department, parroting claims that the coal is indeed needed. A «deal» to speed up the coal phase-out, which at the same time allows burning even more coal in the shorter timeframe serves as the fig leave. It took the Greens – almost to the day – 32 years to successfully end their march through the institutions: By becoming the institution and betraying everything they stood for.Luisa Neubauer und Pauline Brünger wrote a commentary for the German newspaper taz, succinctly describing the dire situation we are in. The consequences of which will be felt worldwide.German climate policy (Symbolic image), photo by Carla HinrichsOn Wednesday, January 11th, police moved in and started the eviction.On Saturday, January 14th, tens of thousands of protesters travelled to Lützerath to support those activists remaining in the village.The police promised «unpleasant images if protesters try to break through to Lützerath».The day ended with several serious injuries, one protester was hospitalised with life-threatening injuries. In one case, police officers continued to beat an injured person despite ongoing treatment by the paramedics. Iza Hoffmann, a paramedic, described the actions of the police as «fear and terror». Journalists say they were assaulted by the police and obstructed in their reporting.One thing is abundantly clear: Every cop showing up to work – work being hitting the heads of protesters – does so by choice. They choose violence. The only good cop is a cop that quits their job.At the time of writing this newsletter, according to the police, the eviction has finished, with all activists but two hiding in a tunnel removed from the village. Ende Gelände mobilises for a return to Lützerath on January, 17th.And that’s the situation we’ll have to deal with. Cops won’t quit their job. Politicians will use climate change only to garner some votes in the next election. RWE will excavate the coal. Germany will miss its climate targets.Activists will continue to give them hell. There’s no other way out.To end on a lighter note, cops stuck in mud and trolled by a protester in a monk’s costume is, simply, the best. Thank you, monk.(((𝕌𝕟𝕚𝕧𝕖𝕣𝕤𝕒𝕝𝕚𝕤𝕞𝕦𝕤𝓤𝓵𝓽𝓻𝓪))) @UniversUltra#Luetzerathbleibt #BennyHill twitter.com/HerrHoert/status/16143865289348464704464 02:24 AM · Jan 15, 2023Storm a Parliament MonthWhile Jair Bolsonaro hides away in Florida, his supporters took to the streets and stormed Brasil’s parliament. Which makes January the official Storm a Parliament Month. I wonder which one is next.It’s easy to categorise these events as just another version of January, 6th. But that’s too simple. For one, storming the parliament has been attempted in Germany before. Didn’t happen in January, though, and was stopped by a total of two police officers.And, as Ryan Broderick argues in Garbage Day, the Brazilian version isn’t a reenactment, it’s an escalation.Also, unlike after the storm on the capitol, Brazilian police was able to detain 1,000 would be insurrectionists.This ain’t intelligenceMaggie Appleton wrote an amazing essay on proving you're a human on a web flooded with generative AI content.Issue number 200 of Last Week in AI provides a look back at 2022. The year was rich with break-throughs (DALL-E 2 was released only in April) and of course a lot of AI hype theatre. Luckily, Emily M. Bender and Alex Hanna made a show out of it and pushed back on some of the more common (and outlandish) claims.Meanwhile, we have ChatGPT running around the hype theatre.Seemingly everybody uses it for everything, but in reality, it’s incredibly hard to know whether the information spouted by the model is true or not. Eva Wolfangel took a closer look at this in German science magazine Spektrum.Wenn ChatGPT also noch so intelligent wirkt, machen wir uns klar: Das ist eine Täuschung. Das System nutzt unsere kognitive Schwäche aus, die Sprachgewandtheit mit Intelligenz in Verbindung bringt.Keep in mind that Microsoft has exclusive usage rights for everything OpenAI publishes. Bing will implement ChatGPT. Google declared a Code Red over ChatGPT’s popularity, acknowledging publicly the danger such models can persist to the business models of IT companies.The implementation of Large Language Models as each interfaces face problems, though. First, as Emily Bender and Chirag Shah argue in Situating Search, LLMs can not present information in a way that allows the searcher to know where it comes from, and hence if the source is reliable or not – or if it exists at all.The other problem, how do you make money out of it? A search with ChatGPT is estimated to cost a cent. This quickly adds up if you take Bing’s size into account.Episode 221 of This Machine Kills discusses the political economy behind these models. In the end, all models are a way to make money, and 2023 will be the year when we see the ways to make money.GPTZero is a tool designed to detect the output of ChatGPT based on linguistic properties. Hugging Face developed a similar tool for GPT-2, which seems to work for ChatGPT, too.This kind of tools might be a future revenue stream for OpenAI and their ilk.But the second reason is to enable a new form of monetization. Flood the zone with bullshit (or facilitate others doing so), then offer paid services to detect said bullshit. (I use bullshit as a technical term for text produced without commitment to truth values; see Frankfurt 2009.) It’s guaranteed to work because as I wrote, the market forces are in place and they will be relentless.Cybercriminals start using ChatGPT. Because why wouldn't they.Want to use ChatGPT, but are an open-source type of person? There’s now an open-source alternative to ChatGPT, but good luck running it.David Holz, founder of Midjourney, admitted that there’s no way to train a model searching proper consent beforehand.The Washington Post created a visual explainer of the process behind generative AI models such as DALL-E or Stable Diffusion.Following GitHub, Stability AI, makers of Stable Diffusion, is now sued over their use of copyrighted content. The site skips on the legalese, while doing a pretty solid job explaining the diffusion process and why they think collage tools such as Stable Diffusion.German public broadcaster, ZDF, published information, including model cards, of the algorithms used to fine-tune personalisation in their digital offering. Well done.China now enforces its AI legislation, meaning the output of generative AI has to be clearly labeled, and is not allowed to be used to produce deep fakes.Microsoft announced VALL-E, a speech synthesiser which only needs three seconds of input to duplicate a person’s voice. I can’t for the life of me imagine what could go wrong.The fight over the EU’s AI Act continues, Germany favours more broad exception for facial recognition technology.Social MediarghI kind of lost interest in Twitter, but thanks to my friends at Twitter Is Going Great I can rest assured that it’s going terrific, with CSAM material still prevalent on the platform and some 3rd party apps cut off from their API without any explanation. So yeah, perfect. Here’s an  interview with Markus Beckedahl explaining the misery from a journalistic perspective. And here Some More News on Musk and free speech.Musk’s takeover drove more than a million people to Mastodon – but many aren’t sticking around. Mastodon’s user numbers still are higher than before the takeover.TikTok has been accused of pushing content promoting eating disorders and self-harm in the feeds of teenagers.TikTok’s success has often been attributed (including by me) to its algorithm. The truth might be slightly different. As Arvind Narayanan argues, the true advantage might be the way TikTok is designed around the algorithm.TikTok’s recommender system is not its secret: rather, it’s the design, which, of course, isn’t secret at all. More generally, in AI applications, the sophistication of the algorithm is rarely the limiting factor. The quality of the design, the data, and the people that make up the system all tend to matter more.This might explain the trouble every other tech company has in replicating TikTok’s success «because they were originally designed for a very different experience, and they are locked into it due to their users’ and creators’ preferences».Facebook, meanwhile was fined 390 million Euro and needs to revamp their recommendation algorithms within the next three months.Can I talk to you about e-mails?Thanks for making it this far.

Let users select the text and hope they can manually input numbers here. But then, put the field in readonly mode, to force them to use the steppers. It’s a click click game, the more clicks the better! Trust me, gamification brings UX delightfulness! 3. Most users might want to input a rounded number for time, make sure your default is set to “current time” to maximize the clicks on those steppers. You built this with heavy JS, you need a click click ROI on those to brag during monthly meetings! Bonus point: if users get the rounded number because they came back at 9:00, it will trigger dopamine.

        "text": "On Twitter and LinkedIn and Mastodon, I share curated articles I read, resources and tools about UX Design, User Research, UI and mobile design, HTML, CSS, the web industry, some process, some inspiration, etc. This is an archive of everything I shared this week. And some extra links that I decided to only share for the blog readers.\n#Now – what I’m up to\nI finally took the time to split my pages, my workshops, teachings and classes now have a dedicated page, if you are curious you can check all my workshops here.\nI also created a very sarcastic “How to build a (not) delightful time picker” (this may or may not be inspired by real life events)\nUser Interview Cards and Resources\nI finished testing prototypes for my User Interview Cards.  Those are finally ready. I added them to the shop yesterday. You can now find them in the User Interview Resources collection, along with other templates and tools to help with your user interview guides.\nTL;DNR the one you should not miss\n#UX\nA list of user frustrations and user deligthers, to build less frustrating experiences in 2023\nInteresting article\n#MobileUX\nInteresting “State of Mobile UX” article. TLDNR: lines between Android and iOS, native and web get blurrier and more and more capabilities (like biometric authentication) come to both supports, too many overlays and in app browsing.\n#Crisis\nDesigning out of difficult times. Design matters, and not just in good times. Design can help overcome issues during volatile bad times, yet, usually design teams are the first ones to get fired when things are economically bad. The article gives a few nice examples of how good design helped shift and solve problems in time of crisis. So, next time you think “yeah, we don’t need those designers”, maybe, think again. McKinsey research has shown that companies that embrace the business value of design are better able to respond to shifting landscapes and generate improved performance\n#Design\nWhy do users prefer certain design? Insights from the landscape theory? Interesting idea: applying the theory of landscape (coherence, complexity, legibility and mystery) to try to understand and predict why users might prefer and interview over another\n#Psychology #Biases\nHaa, all the biases and psychology tricks applied to restaurant menu design. Will you pay attention next time to eat at a restaurant now?\nUnconscious Biases That Get In The Way Of Inclusive Design: confirmation, optimistic, omission, false consensus, perception and status quo bias.\n#Icons\nA very detailed guide to help you draw the perfect icons. With a few bonus tips on how to name them and make them easily findable in your Figma files:\n#AI\nInteresting article how designers can use AI can help streamline repetitive tasks, aka, use AI as a tool to help, instead of seeing it as a threat to your job:\nNavigating the AI revolution: how designers can stay competitive\nHow designers can start using AI at work today | by Steve Dennis | Dec, 2022 | UX Collective\nDesigners can find their place in an AI future, interesting essay on how we all seek inspiration from the same place anyway\nAI-generated answers temporarily banned on coding Q&A site Stack Overflow, due to “a high rate of being incorrect”\n#DataViz\nWow, this is an amazingly detailed article to help you chose which type of dataviz will work best for you audience and data set. I really like that Sara makes the distinction between a beginner audience and an audience used to charts and graphs\n#Inclusion #Name\nWhat the fnu? This is what happens when systems, tools and administrations don’t want to take into account the diversity of the world we live in, you end up with people getting Fnu (for “First Name Unknown”) as first name on official papers.\n#Game\nIntroducing Project Leonardo (video), a more accessible very customizable PlayStation 5 controller for gamers with disabilities. Check the full article for details.\nDid you know that Microsoft has some very detailed guidelines to help you with game accessibility?\nHow a game developer reworked his flash game to make it available to steam users in 2022. I really love those kind of rabbit holes that show how technology evolves and how people adapted. Also the game looks fun.\n#Product Strategy\nSometimes you build something people need without knowing it, sometimes, you hope for the best and it fails. I love the “glorified clock radio” analogy. So, is there some place in the ecosystem for voice assistants in 2023? Amazon thought Alexa would be the next iPhone. Turns out it’s a ‘glorified clock radio.’\n#chatGPT\nAn interesting read on how an early adopter of ChatGPT is using it to help her write her novels\n#Ecommerce\nOvercategorization of the Product Catalog Can Lead to Abandonment (Yet 75% Get It Wrong), another great article by Baymard to help you optimise your ecommerce user experience\nInspiration, fun experiments and great ideas\n#PaperCraft\nIf you like paper craft, you should check out the work of Lisa Rodden, an Australian Paper Engineer, artists and creator\n#Alphabet\nIn case you are curious about the whole NATO phonetic alphabet, here you go\n#LOL\nLOL Verifier: a device that only lets you type lol if you’ve truly laughed out loud.

This guide includes setting up the Web Content note using Templates and QuickAdd, displaying all the notes using Dataview, and more!\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\nThings Needed\n\n\n\nThe Folder Structure I Use\n\n\n\nHow to Create the Web Content using a Template\n\n\n\nParts of My Web Content Note\n\n\n\nHow to Add a New Web Content Note using QuickAdd\n\n\n\nHow to Create the Master List Note\n\n\n\nDownload the Sample Vault\n\n\n\nCredits\nThings Needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObsidian\nTemplates (Core Plugin)\n\n\n\nDataview (Community Plugin)\n\n\n\nQuickAdd (Community Plugin)\n\nThe Folder Structure I Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust like with my daily notes, I use folders to keep the web content in place. All of these notes are inside a main folder called “Interesting Stuff”.\n\n\n\n“Interesting Stuff” is the term I use for saved web content in Obsidian. It helps me distinguish what content to save in Obsidian to prevent the dreaded Collector’s Fallacy. Feel free to use a different term if you like.\n\n\n\n📂 _templates\nThis is the folder that houses the Web Content template. I’ve put an underscore so that this folder appears on top of the navigation panel.\n\n\n\n\n📂 Interesting Stuff\nThis is the main folder that houses the following subfolders below:\n\n\n\n📂 Articles\nThis folder houses all the kinds of web articles.\n\n\n\n\n📂 Book Summaries\nThis is a more specific folder that houses the articles that serve as book summaries such as the ones from StoryShots or Shortform.\n\n\n\n\n📂 Threads\nThis folder includes tweets and long threads from Twitter. Reddit posts and forum threads also fall under this folder.\n\n\n\n\n📂 Videos\nThis usually houses YouTube videos. If a video is part of a course, then it falls under a separate Course folder.\n\n\nHow to Create the Web Content Note using a Template\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Web Content templateI use the Templates core plugin to automatically fill in the content of the web content note.\n\n\n\nHere are the steps to configure and set up the note to create the template:\n\n\n\nCreate a folder called _templates. This will house the templates used for your book notes.\n\n\n\nClick on the Settings button on the bottom left corner and select Core Plugins. Turn on Templates to enable this plugin.\nTemplates plugin in the Core plugins menuLook for Templates under Plugin Options.\n\n\n\nSet the template folder location to _templates.\nCreate a new note and name it “Web Content Template”. Type the following on the note:\n--- \nType: \nAuthor: \nTopic: \n--- \n# {{NAME}} \n\n- Metadata: \n- Author: `= this.Author` \n- Link:: []() \n- Tags:: #interestingstuff/unread\n\n## 🖊️ Literature Notes\n—\n\n## ⚫ Bullet Outline\n—\n\n## 📑 Highlights\n—\n\n# 📰 Full Text\n—Check the next section for an explanation of each element in the template.Parts of My Web Content Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, I explain each part of my web content note including the YAML frontmatter values I use and headers to sort the content out.\n\n\n\nType\n\n\n\nThis is where I indicate if the web content is either an article, thread, book summary, or video.\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\nThis is where I specify the author of the web content. If the web content has multiple authors, you can format it like this: [Author1, Author2].\n\n\n\nThe ‘= this.Author ‘ code on the Metadata bullet allows you to display the name of the author in the YAML frontmatter without manually copying it over.\n\n\n\nTopic\n\n\n\nThis is where I indicate the topic of the web content. Just like with the Author YAML frontmatter, you can use this format: [Topic1, Topic2, Topic3] when including multiple topics.\n\n\n\nLink\n\n\n\nThis is where I put the URL of the web article or video. I prefer placing this as an inline dataview query language (DQL) so as URLs with the name of the publication or platform.\n\n\n\nName\n\n\n\nThe name is where I put the title of the article or video. If the title has a colon (:), I replace it with a dash (-).\n\n\n\nIf it’s a tweet or a thread, I usually make it a sentence that tells what the tweet is all about and includes the name of the user.\n\n\n\nFor example, here is a thread that talks about the myth of achieving photorealism without using photo references.\n\n\n\nIf I were to add it as a note, I would title it “Greg Smallwood on the Myth of Achieving Photo Realism without Photo Reference”. It might be a bit wordy but this helps me immediately tell the topic of the thread just from its title.\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n\nA list of tags I use for web content notes.\n\n\n\nI use tags to specify the status of the web content note. Below, you can see all the tags that I use for these kinds of notes.\n\n\n\n#interestingstuff/unread\nThis is the tag I use for unread web content. Although lately, I’ve been moving my unread and to-read content outside of Obsidian to reduce the number of orphaned notes (notes with no links) in my vault. I’ve been using a combination of Google Keep and Capacities to store web content that I want to read later.\n\n\n\n\n#interestingstuff/read\nThis is the tag I use for web content that I’ve read.\n\n\n\n\n#interestingstuff/nolitnote\nThis is the tag I use to indicate if the note has no literature notes. I don’t always create literature notes out of every web content I consume. Productivity for its own sake isn’t something I want to achieve.\n\n\n\n\n#interestingstuff/litnoteprocessed\nThis is the tag I use to indicate if the note has literature notes.\n\n\n\n\n#interestingstuff/clippings\nThis is the tag I use to indicate if the note has the entire clipping of the web content.\n\n\n\n\n#interestingstuff/spicysource\nThis is essentially the “favorites” tag. I use this for notes that I want to go back to re-read and learn again.\n\nLiterature Notes\n\n\n\nRefactored literature notes from Fighting Infomania – Why 80% of Your Reading is a Waste of Time\n\nThis is the section where I include the literature notes I’ve gathered based on what I’ve learned from the web content and are written based on my own words.\n\n\n\nThere’s no fixed rule that I use when making literature notes, so sometimes I keep them within the note or refactored them into their own note using the Note Refactor plugin.\n\n\n\nAn example of literature notes kept within the web content note. Notes are from Stop Procrastinating Today With Behavioral Science\nIt all boils down to the type of web content: for how-to tutorials, it’s best to keep it within the note while articles that tackle different topics would be better suited for the latter method.\n\n\n\nBullet Outline\n\n\n\nNotes taken from A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden\n\nThere are cases where I prefer using the bullet outline when making notes. Just like with the literature notes, I write these using my own words and keep each bullet short so it doesn’t feel like a slog when reading through it.\n\n\n\nHighlights\n\n\n\nHighlights extracted from An Argument for Making Exercise (Not Diet) the Foundation of Weight Management\n\nThis is the section where I paste the highlights that I’ve copied from Glasp. Glasp is the main app I use for highlighting web content such as articles and videos and pasting them to Obsidian.\n\n\n\nFull Text\n\n\n\nA snippet of Schopenhauer’s 7 Pieces of Advice for Readers\n\nIn rare cases where I clip the entire web article, I put it under this header. I use a browser extension called MarkDownload (Firefox/Chrome) to copy from the clipboard and then paste it under this header.\n\n\n\nFor Twitter threads, I use Thread Reader to unroll the thread and use MarkDownload to copy and paste the contents.\n\n\n\nHow to Add a New Web Content Note using QuickAdd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n❗ Note: This section uses the same steps used to create the book note from my bookshelf tutorial.\nIf you already know how to set up and use QuickAdd, feel free to skip this part and move on to the “How to Create the Master List” sectionQuickAdd is a plugin that lets you quickly add templates and new content to your vault.

You can find it in this GitHub link. The vault has the Dataview and QuickAdd plugins installed.\n\n\n\nTo download and open the vault in Obsidian, follow the instructions below:\n\n\n\nClick on this GitHub link to take you to the download link.\n\n\n\nSelect the latest version of the WebContentLibrary.zip file and download it to your computer.\n\n\n\nUnzip the file.\n\n\n\nOn Obsidian, click on the vault icon and press the Open button.\n\n\n\nSelect the Web Content Library folder to open it as a vault in Obsidian.\nCredits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblacksmithgu: Dataview Plugin\n\n\n\nchhoumann: QuickAdd\n\n\n\ndeathau: MarkDownload\n\n\n\nCal & Amy: Thread Reader\n\n\n\nKazuki Nakayashiki & Kei Watanabe: Glasp\nIf you found this helpful, consider supporting me on Ko-Fi!\n\n\n\nAdvertisementShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\tRelated"

        "html": "<a href=\"https://elliothasacoolstore.com/products/steal\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://elliothasacoolstore.com/products/steal\">STEAL</a><p>This is about kind of techie things, but the real center of this post is feelings. I can only speak for myself. I’m sharing them because I don’t think I’m particularly special, so I’m guessing <em>bits</em> of this will  sound familiar to other people like me<a href=\"https://maya.land/monologues/2023/02/14/mr-openai-i-dont-feel-so-good.html#fn:like\">1</a>. Some of this is still fairly inchoate and I’ll probably return to it somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>When I was a kid on the Internet I felt intense indignation about copy protection. The way certain websites would override right-click, give you a pop up instead so you couldn’t easily save images. I’d insist on finding workarounds to save the things anyway, little pixel witch gifs, to folders from which they’d never be used. Who do you think you are to send bytes to my computer but then try to tell me what to do with them? A webpage felt like a document sent in the mail. Maybe you should be able to sue me if I sell some copy, some collage of it, but you can’t stop me from <em>making</em> the copy, the collage. DVD players that blocked screenshots were an indignity I couldn’t get around, and I fumed.</p>\n\n<p>Now we live in a world where if you share a copy of an illustration hi-res enough to look good on people’s screens, it’ll be on an Aliexpress product as soon as it gets enough likes. Twitter bots looking for “I want this on a t-shirt” to swoop in and automate a dropshipped version.</p>\n\n<p>I have to have a more complicated view about that feeble attempt to protect against image theft in that context. It’s why I never put the illustrations I was putting up on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kixiqu/\">Instagram</a> onto <a href=\"https://pixelfed.org\">Pixelfed</a>; sensible open APIs make it that much easier for some misguided individual<a href=\"https://maya.land/monologues/2023/02/14/mr-openai-i-dont-feel-so-good.html#fn:asshole\">2</a> to vacuum up everything you’ve put out there. I felt uncomfortable with that even as my discomfort seemed to contradict other of my values<a href=\"https://maya.land/monologues/2023/02/14/mr-openai-i-dont-feel-so-good.html#fn:maya\">3</a>. Nuance, maturing opinions…</p>\n\n<p>And yet I have 25 lines of indignant JavaScript tucked into a <a href=\"https://www.tampermonkey.net/\">Tampermonkey</a> script because <a href=\"https://www.libraryireland.com/\">Library Ireland</a> tried to stop me from copying a quote out from their site and How Dare They.</p>\n\n<p>Writing about the web often takes as axiomatic that everyone wants attention online, and more attention is more better and we’re all supposed to Have A Platform and Use Our Platform. I have a social acquaintance with other people who have had their writing land on the front page of <a href=\"https://maya.land/responses/2022/09/09/namespaces-cost.html#fnref:orange\">Hacker News</a>, some of whom routinely have their writing there, and maybe it shouldn’t be surprising that having The Hacker News Community™️ tack a comment section you can’t moderate onto the thing you made isn’t something everyone always loves. This is a part of hypertext where the rubber hits the road, maybe. The freedom to link is the power to brigade.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.boringcactus.com\">The “immortal programming goddess”</a> who <a href=\"https://www.boringcactus.com/assets/fuck-hn.js\">checks for an incoming Hacker News <code>referer</code> header and redirects to a fart noise</a>: heroic, iconic, we have no choice but to etc. etc.</p>\n\n<p>The people who have less alloyed feelings about seeking attention are the ones trying to make a living selling something. I see people – artists selling prints and stickers, ceramicists, embroiderers – bemoan “the algorithm”, the platforms’ recommendation systems that mediate<a href=\"https://maya.land/monologues/2023/02/14/mr-openai-i-dont-feel-so-good.html#fn:mediation\">4</a> the presentation of their photo and video content. What is it that we are meant to contrast the presence of the all-powerful uncaring algorithm <em>to</em>? The past? Uncomfortable to note, but common to see:  guides by and for these folks that advise doing little to none of the traditional marketing work that would have been necessary to their livelihoods before social media. Is the algorithm bad for “taking away” attention from them that they’d never have had in a pre-social media world?</p>\n\n<p>No, this kind of exculpatory line of thought misses a lot of what’s really bad about the status quo by distracting you with a question of entitlement. Better to consider it together with gig work. These artists operate with supposed flexibility and autonomy, but then have to create reels based on rumored understandings of how Instagram will continue directing attention to their posts, their profiles, their sale announcements. These livelihoods entail having to pretend that your boss is not your boss, that you don’t have a boss, that you’re your own boss, and you post about being your own boss sometimes because #smallbusinesslife does okay numbers, but also what cadence do you need to be uploading on and do you have to use the app’s own camera and video editor for it to count? Someone says that they heard from someone who knows a Facebook employee that it works in such-and-such a way, but that was before the update six months ago that everyone remembers for tanking their engagement, their finances, so maybe it doesn’t work that way anymore.</p>\n\n<p>So. If you’re not trying to maximize the attention you get and it comes for you anyway, that’s not all good. And if you’re trying to compete for attention with untold others on a platform where the ground is always shifting yet the house always wins, that’s not all good. Perhaps “more attention is better” is taken on faith if it holds true for the journalists who write about all this stuff, for the Substack commentariat class… but even for we <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule\">the weirdo Posting 1%</a>, I can’t say it feels true enough to generalize.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://artifact.news/\">Artifact</a> is a new app trying to be TikTok for text. I gave it a shot. I was curious as to whether, within the recommendation-system brief it gave itself, it would be more like Instagram reels – where I can sort of steer my way around, watch from searches – or TikTok – where any attempt to direct what I see other than careful Engagement Reactions seems useless. I could do a fuller write-up on it, but… more than anything, I was startled at the portion of the content that seemed to be documenting TikTok trends in blog posts.</p>\n\n<p>You see people commenting on ChatGPT stuff with the worry that machine learning systems will begin to train on the generated output of machine learning systems. Maybe a good rule of thumb that we should have learned by now: <em>never assume <strong>automating</strong> optimization is necessary for some weird thing to happen when there are already a bunch of people trying to optimize.</em> The human TikTokkers creating and following trends and quota-hitting bloggers reifying them are enough to enact that imagined pattern<a href=\"https://maya.land/monologues/2023/02/14/mr-openai-i-dont-feel-so-good.html#fn:centipede\">5</a>. Production turned into consumption turned into engagement, engagement analyzed, content promoted, encouraged, derived… the fact of the promotion and engagement becomes further material for derivation.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t find music on TikTok or Instagram myself, but it’s common these days for songs to go viral there as background music. They say<a href=\"https://maya.land/monologues/2023/02/14/mr-openai-i-dont-feel-so-good.html#fn:news\">6</a> that music producers explicitly design around textures, interesting drops, moments that would be useful to be turned into video backing tracks. Some people talk about that like it’s horrifying that Art might be Degraded in this way. The idea that art forms are shaped by their social context is a little too foundational – foundational to, I dunno, four-fifths of what’s interesting about art – for me to take that seriously. Besides, I like texture<a href=\"https://maya.land/monologues/2023/02/14/mr-openai-i-dont-feel-so-good.html#fn:drop\">7</a>. But it’s a useful illustration of how limiting it is to approach this from an individual opt-in/opt-out mindset<a href=\"https://maya.land/monologues/2023/02/14/mr-openai-i-dont-feel-so-good.html#fn:mindset\">8</a>: I don’t participate in getting my music from TikTok and Instagram, but <em>the world of music that is available for me to listen to is different</em> because we live in a TikTokified world. Because TikTok and Instagram have a recommendation model that uses choice of background music as a big factor in recommendations. Virality casts a long shadow.</p>\n\n<p>I have never published anything under a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software\">FOSS license</a>. Don’t get me wrong here – I’ve given money to open source projects, done some non-coding stuff, filed issues… I do <em>believe</em> in the thing, the heritage of the part of computers that came from acid-dropping academe rather than grindset. I can fairly say I don’t publish code because of my employer’s ridiculous policies<a href=\"https://maya.land/monologues/2023/02/14/mr-openai-i-dont-feel-so-good.html#fn:tweet\">9</a>, but there’s something else as well. Automatic licensing, automatic permission, that’s what you need for industry scale, web scale, planet scale. But I like to get emails from other weirdos asking how things were done, to write back with cheerful comments. I like the inefficiency of it. I like how no one arrives in my inbox with Demands, only ever the beginning of a social interaction.</p>\n\n<p>I have <a href=\"https://maya.land/responses/2022/02/16/links-vs-likes-how-do-they-make-you-feel.html\">loved</a> being linked to. The little bits of email correspondence. The conversations on Mastodon<a href=\"https://maya.land/monologues/2023/02/14/mr-openai-i-dont-feel-so-good.html#fn:twitter\">10</a>. The acquaintanceships with other website proprietors. I have loved being listed in people’s handmade lists. Being aggregated and ranked is a different feeling. And there’s worse coming.</p>\n\n<p>The search engines propose to summarize the contents of the web now (<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/microsoft-openai-chatgpt-search-engine-bing/\">Bing</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/\">Google</a>). This is somewhat like how they have been excerpting bits from pages for a long time, and contains both of the significant downsides of this existing practice: first, that it presents <a href=\"https://hristo-georgiev.com/google-turned-me-into-a-serial-killer\">unvetted “information”</a> with all the epistemic authority of the search engine’s brand, and second, through bypassing sending people to the original sources, it <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyrics-site-genius-com-accuses-google-of-lifting-its-content-11560677400\">rips away</a> from the original publishers whatever they had hoped to get from people visiting their pages. Ad revenue? Prestige? Clicks through to other material? All arrogated to the search engine.</p>\n\n<p>These two effects would be bad enough to merit the commentariat’s angst. There’s a third and less concrete way it bothers me.</p>\n\n<p>I have been fine with search engines linking to my posts, my pages. The web search feels virtuous in an era of Twitter jokes showing up on TikTok made into trends for blog posts aggregated into recommendation feeds…</p>\n\n<p>The few things Google sends people to my site for seem reasonable enough. Google didn’t offer searchers anything about the cursed idea of dithering images with CSS before I did <a href=\"https://maya.land/monologues/2021/02/15/css-dither.html\">my write-up</a>, which I know because I was searching extensively assuming someone must have done it already. That it is now an answer they give to similar queries: reasonable.</p>\n\n<p>But I have never aspired to create neutral reference content. I only ever want to write things with enough voice that someone who’s on my frequency will enjoy it, and enough that someone who dislikes my style will wrinkle their nose and tab away. This sorting effect seems to me to be at the heart of what niche self-publishing ought to be able to offer; I’m not trying to maximize attention! I don’t mind when the search engines ignore me.</p>\n\n<p>This site has been too much of an experiment for me to claim now that I have a grand theory about it, about similar sites – but certainly by now I have instincts, feelings…</p>\n\n<p>…and making my writing available for automated summarization? So someone can sell ads by a depersonalized version of my stuff? The feeling is nausea.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not a lawyer. One thing I understand to be true of copyright is that you are never meant to be able to use it to protect your ideas, but only your expression of your own ideas. Isn’t it exactly this expression that the large language models propose to be able to recreate, to sand off the things that make your version yours? It doesn’t have to be copyright infringement to be plagiarism – but then I suppose copyright never did much for anyone not shelling out for a lawyer.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t derive the kind of gain from this site that justifies getting angry about “stolen” “traffic”. The <em>professional</em> artists and writers can point to the material effects on them, and that’s all real. People visiting <em>my</em> little blog posts more or less will make no material difference to my life. This line of reasoning – guesstimating impact – seems a bit hollow, though, as consolation goes. If there are other people out there who, like me, participate in the open web because we’re motivated by the small joys of connecting with similar weirdos, sharing with the younger weirdos coming up… well, feelings can cancel each other out. Does it feel good to be made gristle for a giant corporation’s sausage-making machine, even on your own independent website? Can I really tell people <a href=\"https://maya.land/internet/personal-site/\">making a personal website is great</a> with that as a caveat?</p>\n\n<p>Where do we go when <em>good web citizenship itself</em> <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/09/16/1059598/this-artist-is-dominating-ai-generated-art-and-hes-not-happy-about-it/\">may be biting people</a>?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rutkowski has also added alt text in English when uploading his work online. These descriptions of the images are useful for people with visual impairments who use screen reader software, and they help search engines rank the images as well. This also makes them easy to scrape, and the AI model knows which images are relevant to prompts. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s enough to make me consider running back to <a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web\">cozy group chats</a>, removing anything scrutable from public availability.

Never mind what hypercapitalist nightmare the funders have in mind for it. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2022/09/16/midjourney-founder-david-holz-on-the-impact-of-ai-on-art-imagination-and-the-creative-economy/\">They don’t think they need artists’ consent</a>, so they don’t really think they need mine. Levers exist for me to communicate my discontent, opt out of search, but only because I have a role worth small respect as my own <em>server admin</em>… so there’s some tradition to let me indicate how not to overload my system.</p>\n\n<p>I know we all know by now that the ad industry is low-sulfur Satan. But it is also true that my mother is a librarian and her mother is a librarian and I always kind of looked at Google and thought, you know, maybe being a Professional Computer Person could end up being a little like being a librarian too. Family joked about high-school age me – “Mayapedia!” – for my enthusiastic insistence on looking up anything that was wondered about in conversation.

        "text": "STEALThis is about kind of techie things, but the real center of this post is feelings. I can only speak for myself. I’m sharing them because I don’t think I’m particularly special, so I’m guessing bits of this will  sound familiar to other people like me1. Some of this is still fairly inchoate and I’ll probably return to it somewhere.\n\nWhen I was a kid on the Internet I felt intense indignation about copy protection. The way certain websites would override right-click, give you a pop up instead so you couldn’t easily save images. I’d insist on finding workarounds to save the things anyway, little pixel witch gifs, to folders from which they’d never be used. Who do you think you are to send bytes to my computer but then try to tell me what to do with them? A webpage felt like a document sent in the mail. Maybe you should be able to sue me if I sell some copy, some collage of it, but you can’t stop me from making the copy, the collage. DVD players that blocked screenshots were an indignity I couldn’t get around, and I fumed.\n\nNow we live in a world where if you share a copy of an illustration hi-res enough to look good on people’s screens, it’ll be on an Aliexpress product as soon as it gets enough likes. Twitter bots looking for “I want this on a t-shirt” to swoop in and automate a dropshipped version.\n\nI have to have a more complicated view about that feeble attempt to protect against image theft in that context. It’s why I never put the illustrations I was putting up on Instagram onto Pixelfed; sensible open APIs make it that much easier for some misguided individual2 to vacuum up everything you’ve put out there. I felt uncomfortable with that even as my discomfort seemed to contradict other of my values3. Nuance, maturing opinions…\n\nAnd yet I have 25 lines of indignant JavaScript tucked into a Tampermonkey script because Library Ireland tried to stop me from copying a quote out from their site and How Dare They.\n\nWriting about the web often takes as axiomatic that everyone wants attention online, and more attention is more better and we’re all supposed to Have A Platform and Use Our Platform. I have a social acquaintance with other people who have had their writing land on the front page of Hacker News, some of whom routinely have their writing there, and maybe it shouldn’t be surprising that having The Hacker News Community™️ tack a comment section you can’t moderate onto the thing you made isn’t something everyone always loves. This is a part of hypertext where the rubber hits the road, maybe. The freedom to link is the power to brigade.\n\nThe “immortal programming goddess” who checks for an incoming Hacker News referer header and redirects to a fart noise: heroic, iconic, we have no choice but to etc. etc.\n\nThe people who have less alloyed feelings about seeking attention are the ones trying to make a living selling something. I see people – artists selling prints and stickers, ceramicists, embroiderers – bemoan “the algorithm”, the platforms’ recommendation systems that mediate4 the presentation of their photo and video content. What is it that we are meant to contrast the presence of the all-powerful uncaring algorithm to? The past? Uncomfortable to note, but common to see:  guides by and for these folks that advise doing little to none of the traditional marketing work that would have been necessary to their livelihoods before social media. Is the algorithm bad for “taking away” attention from them that they’d never have had in a pre-social media world?\n\nNo, this kind of exculpatory line of thought misses a lot of what’s really bad about the status quo by distracting you with a question of entitlement. Better to consider it together with gig work. These artists operate with supposed flexibility and autonomy, but then have to create reels based on rumored understandings of how Instagram will continue directing attention to their posts, their profiles, their sale announcements. These livelihoods entail having to pretend that your boss is not your boss, that you don’t have a boss, that you’re your own boss, and you post about being your own boss sometimes because #smallbusinesslife does okay numbers, but also what cadence do you need to be uploading on and do you have to use the app’s own camera and video editor for it to count? Someone says that they heard from someone who knows a Facebook employee that it works in such-and-such a way, but that was before the update six months ago that everyone remembers for tanking their engagement, their finances, so maybe it doesn’t work that way anymore.\n\nSo. If you’re not trying to maximize the attention you get and it comes for you anyway, that’s not all good. And if you’re trying to compete for attention with untold others on a platform where the ground is always shifting yet the house always wins, that’s not all good. Perhaps “more attention is better” is taken on faith if it holds true for the journalists who write about all this stuff, for the Substack commentariat class… but even for we the weirdo Posting 1%, I can’t say it feels true enough to generalize.\n\nArtifact is a new app trying to be TikTok for text. I gave it a shot. I was curious as to whether, within the recommendation-system brief it gave itself, it would be more like Instagram reels – where I can sort of steer my way around, watch from searches – or TikTok – where any attempt to direct what I see other than careful Engagement Reactions seems useless. I could do a fuller write-up on it, but… more than anything, I was startled at the portion of the content that seemed to be documenting TikTok trends in blog posts.\n\nYou see people commenting on ChatGPT stuff with the worry that machine learning systems will begin to train on the generated output of machine learning systems. Maybe a good rule of thumb that we should have learned by now: never assume automating optimization is necessary for some weird thing to happen when there are already a bunch of people trying to optimize. The human TikTokkers creating and following trends and quota-hitting bloggers reifying them are enough to enact that imagined pattern5. Production turned into consumption turned into engagement, engagement analyzed, content promoted, encouraged, derived… the fact of the promotion and engagement becomes further material for derivation.\n\nI don’t find music on TikTok or Instagram myself, but it’s common these days for songs to go viral there as background music. They say6 that music producers explicitly design around textures, interesting drops, moments that would be useful to be turned into video backing tracks. Some people talk about that like it’s horrifying that Art might be Degraded in this way. The idea that art forms are shaped by their social context is a little too foundational – foundational to, I dunno, four-fifths of what’s interesting about art – for me to take that seriously. Besides, I like texture7. But it’s a useful illustration of how limiting it is to approach this from an individual opt-in/opt-out mindset8: I don’t participate in getting my music from TikTok and Instagram, but the world of music that is available for me to listen to is different because we live in a TikTokified world. Because TikTok and Instagram have a recommendation model that uses choice of background music as a big factor in recommendations. Virality casts a long shadow.\n\nI have never published anything under a FOSS license. Don’t get me wrong here – I’ve given money to open source projects, done some non-coding stuff, filed issues… I do believe in the thing, the heritage of the part of computers that came from acid-dropping academe rather than grindset. I can fairly say I don’t publish code because of my employer’s ridiculous policies9, but there’s something else as well. Automatic licensing, automatic permission, that’s what you need for industry scale, web scale, planet scale. But I like to get emails from other weirdos asking how things were done, to write back with cheerful comments. I like the inefficiency of it. I like how no one arrives in my inbox with Demands, only ever the beginning of a social interaction.\n\nI have loved being linked to. The little bits of email correspondence. The conversations on Mastodon10. The acquaintanceships with other website proprietors. I have loved being listed in people’s handmade lists. Being aggregated and ranked is a different feeling. And there’s worse coming.\n\nThe search engines propose to summarize the contents of the web now (Bing, Google). This is somewhat like how they have been excerpting bits from pages for a long time, and contains both of the significant downsides of this existing practice: first, that it presents unvetted “information” with all the epistemic authority of the search engine’s brand, and second, through bypassing sending people to the original sources, it rips away from the original publishers whatever they had hoped to get from people visiting their pages. Ad revenue? Prestige? Clicks through to other material? All arrogated to the search engine.\n\nThese two effects would be bad enough to merit the commentariat’s angst. There’s a third and less concrete way it bothers me.\n\nI have been fine with search engines linking to my posts, my pages. The web search feels virtuous in an era of Twitter jokes showing up on TikTok made into trends for blog posts aggregated into recommendation feeds…\n\nThe few things Google sends people to my site for seem reasonable enough. Google didn’t offer searchers anything about the cursed idea of dithering images with CSS before I did my write-up, which I know because I was searching extensively assuming someone must have done it already. That it is now an answer they give to similar queries: reasonable.\n\nBut I have never aspired to create neutral reference content. I only ever want to write things with enough voice that someone who’s on my frequency will enjoy it, and enough that someone who dislikes my style will wrinkle their nose and tab away. This sorting effect seems to me to be at the heart of what niche self-publishing ought to be able to offer; I’m not trying to maximize attention! I don’t mind when the search engines ignore me.\n\nThis site has been too much of an experiment for me to claim now that I have a grand theory about it, about similar sites – but certainly by now I have instincts, feelings…\n\n…and making my writing available for automated summarization? So someone can sell ads by a depersonalized version of my stuff? The feeling is nausea.\n\nI’m not a lawyer. One thing I understand to be true of copyright is that you are never meant to be able to use it to protect your ideas, but only your expression of your own ideas. Isn’t it exactly this expression that the large language models propose to be able to recreate, to sand off the things that make your version yours? It doesn’t have to be copyright infringement to be plagiarism – but then I suppose copyright never did much for anyone not shelling out for a lawyer.\n\nI don’t derive the kind of gain from this site that justifies getting angry about “stolen” “traffic”. The professional artists and writers can point to the material effects on them, and that’s all real. People visiting my little blog posts more or less will make no material difference to my life. This line of reasoning – guesstimating impact – seems a bit hollow, though, as consolation goes. If there are other people out there who, like me, participate in the open web because we’re motivated by the small joys of connecting with similar weirdos, sharing with the younger weirdos coming up… well, feelings can cancel each other out. Does it feel good to be made gristle for a giant corporation’s sausage-making machine, even on your own independent website? Can I really tell people making a personal website is great with that as a caveat?\n\nWhere do we go when good web citizenship itself may be biting people?\n\n\n  Rutkowski has also added alt text in English when uploading his work online. These descriptions of the images are useful for people with visual impairments who use screen reader software, and they help search engines rank the images as well. This also makes them easy to scrape, and the AI model knows which images are relevant to prompts. \n\n\nIt’s enough to make me consider running back to cozy group chats, removing anything scrutable from public availability. Sending out printed content with stamps.\n\nI said that Google sends people to my stuff sometimes. That’s been true, but I’m hoping it’ll stop. I set up a robots.txt file, and I’ll switch it to an allowlist approach. I added meta tags in the head11.\n\nI don’t think it’ll ensure anything with regards to the model training; the pattern they’re establishing for images is setting up the datasets under the auspices of some “non-profit” “research” institution and gosh isn’t it all the most fair use thing you can imagine? Never mind what hypercapitalist nightmare the funders have in mind for it. They don’t think they need artists’ consent, so they don’t really think they need mine. Levers exist for me to communicate my discontent, opt out of search, but only because I have a role worth small respect as my own server admin… so there’s some tradition to let me indicate how not to overload my system.\n\nI know we all know by now that the ad industry is low-sulfur Satan. But it is also true that my mother is a librarian and her mother is a librarian and I always kind of looked at Google and thought, you know, maybe being a Professional Computer Person could end up being a little like being a librarian too. Family joked about high-school age me – “Mayapedia!” – for my enthusiastic insistence on looking up anything that was wondered about in conversation. Search has been a force for good in my life, over and above the good of open publication. To remove my own stuff, my own little pen recommendations and book reviews and tiny Chinese videogame handheld info… it’s sad.\n\nYou, reader, when you came here – likely from Mastodon – you reached out with your computer, your phone, to my server, where I had assembled my nonsense ready to send back to you. I sent you gold picture frames and a starfield GIF12 and a moon phase emoji with JavaScript to match it to the great moon phase emoji in the sky. And my writing – overwrought, terminally online, smeared with syntactic remnants of whatever book I last read. I put it together for you. The stitching is visible, crooked seams.\n\nWill the future hold clean summaries, phrasings less convoluted than mine? A chatbot delivering the hallucinated view from nowhere? Will you be able to fine-tune a Maya model 20% less annoying than the real one?\n\nThere are men in California ready to sell ads on its sides.\n\n\n  \n      At least a bit technical.

        "html": "<p>This post that you’re reading went through a journey to get here. It was written in WordPress under an installation at wp.adamfortuna.com under my 17-year-old <a href=\"https://wp.adamfortuna.com/links/dreamhost\">Dreamhost</a> account that hosts a dozen sites for $7/month (including <a href=\"https://hardcover.app\">Hardcover</a> and <a href=\"https://minafi.com\">Minafi’s blogs</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This domain, <a href=\"https://adamfortuna.com\">adamfortuna.com</a>, is a Next.js 13 site deployed on Vercel and using Next’s new App directory. The Next.js app uses GraphQL to query WordPress and get the latest posts and generate every page on this site ahead of time for super-speedy access.</p>\n\n\n\nMidJourney generated image based on the title of this post (exact text at the end of this post).<p>This is the idea behind a “Headless CMS” (Content Management System). WordPress (the headless CMS) handles the post creation and this Next.js site handles the user-facing side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last decade, the Headless CMS approach has improved to the point where now it’s utterly amazing. This post will look into the different pieces needed and how they work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress Setup</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To start things off, you’ll need to install WordPress (duh). I use <a href=\"https://wp.adamfortuna.com/links/dreamhost\">Dreamhost</a> for hosting my WordPress sites, with CloudFlare handling the DNS side.</p>\n\n\n\nwp subdomain handled by Dreamhost, root domain by Vercel.<p>Dreamhost has a one-click installer that will do everything you need – create the MySQL database, install WordPress, set up your SSL certificates – all of it. It’s easier than running WordPress locally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your site is set up, you can create an account. The most important setting you’ll need to change is under <em>Settings -&gt; General</em>. Keep your WordPress Address to the subdomain you’re hosting WordPress under, but change the Site Address to the site you want to be the public face.</p>\n\n\n\nSite URL is what users will visit.<p>This <em>should</em> work, but unfortunately, WordPress isn’t quite so smart. If you try to write a post you’ll receive non-stop web console errors like this:</p>\n\n\n<pre><code>Access to fetch at <span>'https://adamfortuna.com/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/6730?_locale=user'</span> <span>from</span> origin <span>'https://wp.adamfortuna.com'</span> has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn<span>'t pass access control check: The value of the '</span>Access-Control-Allow-Origin<span>' header in the response must not be the wildcard '</span>*<span>' when the request'</span>s credentials mode is <span>'include'</span>.</code><span>Code language:</span> <span>JavaScript</span> <span>(</span><span>javascript</span><span>)</span></pre>\n\n\n<p>The problem is that the WordPress admin uses “Site Address” internally for a <em>lot</em> of stuff. To fix this you’ll need to update the <code>rest_url</code> to use the <code>home_url()</code> rather than the <code>site_url()</code>. Open up the <strong>functions.php</strong> file in your WordPress theme and add this line at the bottom.</p>\n\n\n<pre><code>add_filter(<span>'rest_url'</span>, <span><span>function</span><span>($url)</span> </span>{\n  <span>return</span> str_replace(home_url(), site_url(), $url);\n});</code><span>Code language:</span> <span>PHP</span> <span>(</span><span>php</span><span>)</span></pre>\n\n\n<p>To update this file you can FTP into your server or install a WordPress plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-file-manager/\">WP File Manager</a>. After this is done you should be able to write posts and use WordPress as expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress API via GraphQL</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The crux of all of this is being able to access your WordPress data from your Next.js (or Eleventy, etc) app. For this, you’ll need a few plugins:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.wpgraphql.com/\"><strong>WPGraphQL</strong></a> – This is THE plugin. It’s amazing. Live it. Love it. It’ll create a GraphQL API for everything you need. You can decide to make the API public if you want to access it on the client side or limit it to authenticated users only. Since I’m generating everything on the server I’m using the authenticated API.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/Basic-Auth\">JSON Basic Authentication</a></strong> – If you want to access raw excerpts, create comments or other restricted data, you’ll need to make authorized API calls.  I’ve used this plugin from a few sites and it’s solid.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-smart-cache\">WPGraphQL Smart Cache</a></strong> – Usually with WordPress you’d want to cache the pages generated. With a headless CMS you’ll want to cache the API calls.</li>\n</ul><p>Side note: Some parts of the API are only available if you’re authenticated. Post excerpts, for example, are only available in “rendered HTML” form unless you authenticate. If you need these for your meta description you’ll need to either parse the HTML or authenticate with the API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my setup, I decided to restrict the GraphQL API to only authenticated users. I’m building everything on the server, so there’s no reason to leave it open to the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I added pagination, I wanted to get <em>every</em> post in a single API call. Unfortunately, WPGraphQL has a maximum limit of 100 elements. If you’d like to increase this, open up the functions.php file for your theme and add the following to the very bottom.</p>\n\n\n<pre><code><span>// Increase the graphql page limit</span>\nadd_filter( <span>'graphql_connection_max_query_amount'</span>, <span><span>function</span><span>( $amount, $source, $args, $context, $info  )</span> </span>{\n  $amount = <span>1000</span>; <span>// increase post limit to 1000</span>\n  <span>return</span> $amount;\n}, <span>10</span>, <span>5</span> );</code><span>Code language:</span> <span>PHP</span> <span>(</span><span>php</span><span>)</span></pre>\n\n\n<p>After that, you should be able to fetch up to 1,000 posts at once!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can head over to the GraphiQL IDE and try a query. You can click on the avatar to run the command under your user.</p>\n\n\n\nFetch from GraphQL<p>Now it’s time to hit the API!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using GraphQL from Next.js </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pick and choose which GraphQL client you prefer. I used <a href=\"https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client\">@apollo/client</a> on <a href=\"https://hardcover.app\">Hardcover</a>, but decided to use regular <code>fetch</code> for this site. Here’s my setup for how that works:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Side note: I’m somewhat new to TypeScript. We’re using it on <a href=\"https://hardcover.app\">Hardcover</a>, but I’m far from an expert. If you notice ways this code could be improved, you can always <a href=\"https://adamfortuna.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#05666a6b7164714564616468636a7771706b642b666a68\">email me</a>, or message me on Mastodon at <a href=\"https://ruby.social/@adam\">@<span>[email protected]</span></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>src/lib/wordpressClient.ts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the client that’ll be used to make GraphQL calls. The hash is to create a unique URL call that way Next.js can cache the results of it. <em>Side note: the hash likely isn’t needed, but Next.js 13 app features are still in alpha. I anticipate removing this once it’s more stable.</em></p>\n\n\n<pre><code><span>import</span> { Md5 } <span>from</span> <span>'ts-md5'</span>\n<span>export</span> <span>const</span> fetchClient = ({\n  url,\n  key,\n  query,\n  variables = {},\n}: {\n  url: <span>string</span>\n  key: <span>string</span>\n  query: <span>string</span>\n  variables?: <span>any</span>\n}) =&gt; {\n  <span>const</span> hash = Md5.hashStr(\n    <span>JSON</span>.stringify({\n      ...{\n        url,\n        query,\n        key,\n      },\n      ...variables,\n    }),\n  )\n  <span>return</span> fetch(<span>`<span>${url}</span>#<span>${hash}</span>)}`</span>, {\n    method: <span>'POST'</span>,\n    cache: <span>'force-cache'</span>,\n    next: {\n      revalidate: <span>60</span> * <span>60</span>, <span>// 1 hour</span>\n    },\n    headers: {\n      <span>'Content-Type'</span>: <span>'application/json'</span>,\n      Authorization: <span>`Basic <span>${key}</span>`</span>,\n    },\n    body: <span>JSON</span>.stringify({\n      query,\n      variables,\n    }),\n  }).then(<span>(<span><span>res</span></span>) =&gt;</span> res.json())\n}\n<span>export</span> <span>const</span> adamfortunaClient = <span>(<span>{ <span>query</span>, <span>variables</span> = {} }: { <span>query</span>: <span>string</span>; <span>variables</span>?: <span>any</span> }</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n  <span>return</span> fetchClient({\n    url: <span>'https://wp.adamfortuna.com/graphql'</span>,\n    key: <span>String</span>(process.env.WP_ADAMFORTUNA_TOKEN),\n    query,\n    variables,\n  })\n}</code><span>Code language:</span> <span>TypeScript</span> <span>(</span><span>typescript</span><span>)</span></pre>\n\n\n<p>The <code>WP_ADAMFORTUNA_TOKEN</code> environment variable is a Bearer token with my username and password.

It has two responsibilities: getting the current post and preparing all possible paths.</p>\n\n\n<pre><code><span>import</span> { notFound } <span>from</span> <span>'next/navigation'</span>\n<span>import</span> { Article } <span>from</span> <span>'@/components/articles/Article'</span>\n<span>import</span> { getPostOrPageBySlug } <span>from</span> <span>'@/queries/wordpress/getPostOrPageBySlug'</span>\n<span>import</span> { getRecentPosts } <span>from</span> <span>'@/queries/wordpress/getRecentPosts'</span>\n<span>interface</span> PageProps {\n  params: {\n    slug: <span>string</span>\n  }\n}\n<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>Page</span>(<span>{ params: { slug } }: PageProps</span>) </span>{\n  <span>const</span> article = <span>await</span> getPostOrPageBySlug(slug)\n  <span>if</span> (!article) {\n    notFound()\n  }\n  <span>return</span> &lt;Article article={article} /&gt;\n}\n<span>export</span> <span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>generateStaticParams</span>(<span></span>) </span>{\n  <span>const</span> { articles } = <span>await</span> getRecentPosts({\n    count: <span>1000</span>\n  })\n  <span>return</span> articles\n    .map(<span>(<span><span>article</span></span>) =&gt;</span> ({\n      slug: article.slug,\n    }))\n}\n</code><span>Code language:</span> <span>TypeScript</span> <span>(</span><span>typescript</span><span>)</span></pre>\n\n\n<p>That’s really it. There are three important parts to this page:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The call to <strong><code>generateStaticParams</code></strong> is only run on the server by Vercel when I deploy the site. That’ll find every article that needs a standalone page and return all of their slugs. When Vercel deploys the app, it’ll create the page with that slug – hitting the API and caching the result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The call to <strong><code>getPostOrPageBySlug</code></strong> (which I’ll show next) will find the actual article by the slug. I’m using post or page because I want to be able to create a page at the URL <a href=\"https://adamfortuna.com/about\">/about</a> or a blog post like <a href=\"https://adamfortuna.com/40\">/40</a> and have a single route for both of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, render the entire article using the <code><strong>&lt;Article /&gt;</strong></code> component. This will output the article header, the body, author information, and <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Webmention\">webmentions</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>src/queries/wordpress/getPostOrPageBySlug.ts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last piece is the script that’ll set up the GraphQL calls and parse the response into types your app expects. In my case, I created an <code>Article</code> type. I’m skipping over the <code>parsePage</code> and <code>parsePost</code> functions, but those just take the result from the GraphQL query and return an object.</p>\n\n\n<pre><code><span>import</span> { adamfortunaClient, parsePage, parsePost } <span>from</span> <span>'@/lib/wordpressClient'</span>\n<span>export</span> <span>const</span> findWordpressPost = <span>`\nquery GetWordPressPost($slug: String!) {\n  post: postBy(slug: $slug) {\n    title\n    content\n    excerpt(format: RAW)\n    date\n    slug\n    featuredImage {\n      node {\n        sourceUrl\n        mediaDetails {\n          width\n          height\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    tags {\n      nodes {\n        name\n        slug\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  page: pageBy(uri: $slug) {\n    title\n    content\n    date\n    slug\n    featuredImage {\n      node {\n        sourceUrl\n        mediaDetails {\n          width\n          height\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n`</span>\n<span>export</span> <span>const</span> getPostOrPageBySlug = <span>(<span><span>slug</span>: <span>string</span></span>) =&gt;</span> {\n  <span>return</span> adamfortunaClient({\n    query: findWordpressPost,\n    variables: {\n      slug,\n    },\n  }).then(<span>(<span><span>result</span></span>) =&gt;</span> {\n    <span>if</span> (!result.data.post &amp;&amp; !result.data.page) {\n      <span>return</span> <span>null</span>\n    }\n    <span>if</span> (result.data.post) {\n      <span>return</span> parsePost(\n        {\n          ...result.data.post,\n          project: <span>'adamfortuna'</span>,\n        },\n        <span>true</span>,\n      )\n    }\n    <span>if</span> (result.data.page) {\n      <span>return</span> parsePage({\n        ...result.data.page,\n        project: <span>'adamfortuna'</span>,\n      })\n    }\n    <span>return</span> <span>null</span>\n  })\n}</code><span>Code language:</span> <span>TypeScript</span> <span>(</span><span>typescript</span><span>)</span></pre>\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot going on here. Most of it is just a regular GraphQL query. I’ve learned to love GraphQL for projects like this. I can specify exactly what I want the API to return, even nesting arrays and objects multiple levels deep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WPGraphQL WordPress plugin has settings for depth limit which is handy if you’re making this API public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing to note here: The Post is looked up by “slug”, while the Page is looked up by “uri”. This is by design. I’m in the process of moving over some old photo posts from my previous Middleman blog. This type of lookup allows pages like <a href=\"https://adamfortuna.com/photos/japan\">/photos/japan</a> to be handled by this same query (although that needs a route at <code>[...slug]</code> as the root route).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>src/app/[slug]/head.tsx</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next.js 13 has an amazing new addition: <a href=\"https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/file-conventions/head\">head files</a>. These will run during the same page load as your page and populate the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the page. This is needed for the <a href=\"https://ogp.me/\">OpenGraph tags</a>. </p>\n\n\n<pre><code><span>import</span> { notFound } <span>from</span> <span>'next/navigation'</span>\n<span>import</span> { getPostOrPageBySlug } <span>from</span> <span>'@/queries/wordpress/getPostOrPageBySlug'</span>\n<span>import</span> ArticleMetadata <span>from</span> <span>'@/components/articles/ArticleMetadata'</span>\n<span>import</span> GlobalHead <span>from</span> <span>'../globalHead'</span>\n<span>const</span> Head = <span>async</span> ({ params }: { params: { slug: <span>string</span> } }) =&gt; {\n  <span>const</span> article = <span>await</span> getPostOrPageBySlug(params.slug)\n  <span>if</span> (!article) {\n    notFound()\n  }\n  <span>return</span> (\n    &lt;&gt;\n      &lt;title&gt;{article.title}&lt;<span>/title&gt;\n      &lt;GlobalHead /</span>&gt;\n      &lt;ArticleMetadata article={article} /&gt;\n    &lt;<span>/&gt;\n  )\n}\nexport default Head</span></code><span>Code language:</span> <span>TypeScript</span> <span>(</span><span>typescript</span><span>)</span></pre>\n\n\n<p>You’ll notice that both the page.ts and the head.ts files both use the same <code>getPostOrPageBySlug</code> query. This is where it becomes handy that Next.js caches the fetch call. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The head contains about what you’d expect:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>src/app/globalHead.tsx</strong></p>\n\n\n<pre><code><span>const</span> GlobalHead = <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {\n  <span>return</span> (\n    &lt;&gt;\n      &lt;meta name=<span>\"viewport\"</span> content=<span>\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"</span> /&gt;\n      &lt;link href=<span>\"/favicon.ico\"</span> rel=<span>\"shortcut icon\"</span> /&gt;\n      &lt;link rel=<span>\"alternate\"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>\"application/rss+xml\"</span> href=<span>\"https://feeds.feedburner.com/adamfortuna\"</span> /&gt;\n      &lt;link href=<span>\"https://github.com/adamfortuna\"</span> rel=<span>\"me\"</span> /&gt;\n      &lt;link rel=<span>\"webmention\"</span> href=<span>\"https://wp.adamfortuna.com/wp-json/webmention/1.0/endpoint\"</span> /&gt;\n      &lt;link rel=<span>\"http://webmention.org/\"</span> href=<span>\"https://wp.adamfortuna.com/wp-json/webmention/1.0/endpoint\"</span> /&gt;\n    &lt;<span>/&gt;\n  )\n}\nexport default GlobalHead</span></code><span>Code language:</span> <span>TypeScript</span> <span>(</span><span>typescript</span><span>)</span></pre>\n\n\n<p><strong>src/components/articles/ArticleMetadata.ts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly the article metadata. I originally wanted to use <a href=\"https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo\">next-seo</a> for this. That module uses next/head to add the header info, which isn’t compatible with Next.js 13’s new app directory. Instead, we can do this manually.</p>\n\n\n<pre><code><span>import</span> { Article } <span>from</span> <span>'@/types'</span>\n<span>const</span> ArticleMetadata = <span>(<span>{ <span>article</span> }: { <span>article</span>: <span>Article</span> }</span>) =&gt;</span> (\n  &lt;&gt;\n    &lt;meta property=<span>\"og:title\"</span> content={article.title} /&gt;\n    &lt;meta property=<span>\"og:type\"</span> content=<span>\"article\"</span> /&gt;\n    &lt;meta property=<span>\"og:url\"</span> content={<span>`<span>${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL}</span>/<span>${article.slug}</span>`</span>} /&gt;\n    {article.featuredImage &amp;&amp; (\n      &lt;&gt;\n        &lt;meta property=<span>\"og:image\"</span> content={article.featuredImage.sourceUrl} /&gt;\n        {article.featuredImage.mediaDetails &amp;&amp; (\n          &lt;&gt;\n            &lt;meta property=<span>\"og:image:width\"</span> content={<span>String</span>(article.featuredImage.mediaDetails.width)} /&gt;\n            &lt;meta property=<span>\"og:image:height\"</span> content={<span>String</span>(article.featuredImage.mediaDetails.height)} /&gt;\n          &lt;<span>/&gt;\n        )}\n      &lt;/</span>&gt;\n    )}\n    &lt;meta property=<span>\"og:description\"</span> content={article.excerpt || article.title} /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=<span>\"description\"</span> content={article.excerpt || article.title} /&gt;\n    &lt;meta property=<span>\"article:published_time\"</span> content={article.date} /&gt;\n    &lt;meta property=<span>\"article:author\"</span> content=<span>\"Adam Fortuna\"</span> /&gt;\n    &lt;meta property=<span>\"article:section\"</span> content=<span>\"Technology\"</span> /&gt;\n    {article.tags &amp;&amp; article.tags.length &gt; <span>0</span> &amp;&amp; (\n      &lt;meta property=<span>\"article:tag\"</span> content={article.tags?.map(<span>(<span><span>t</span></span>) =&gt;</span> t.name).join(<span>','</span>)} /&gt;\n    )}\n    &lt;meta name=<span>\"twitter:card\"</span> content=<span>\"summary\"</span> /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=<span>\"twitter:creator\"</span> content=<span>\"@adamfortuna\"</span> /&gt;\n  &lt;<span>/&gt;\n)\nexport default ArticleMetadata\n</span></code><span>Code language:</span> <span>TypeScript</span> <span>(</span><span>typescript</span><span>)</span></pre>\n\n\n<p>Some of this is hardcoded because this blog doesn’t have multiple authors. You could just as easily fetch author data from the WordPress API and fill that in here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Seeing it in Action</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With this running, you can see the page you’re looking at right now! Since this blog will likely change over time, I’ll save a snapshot of what it looks like today:</p>\n\n\n\nA sample screenshot of how this looks today.<p>And with that, we have a blog page on Next.js 13, backed by a headless WordPress GraphQL API that’s generated and available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Webmentions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The last step of this journey (so far) was the question of how to handle comments. On my investing and <a href=\"https://minafi.com\">FIRE blog</a> I went with traditional comments. People could enter their name, email and optionally a URL and it’d show up as a comment. Super-basic, the same way comments have worked since the turn of the millennia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there’s a problem with comments. Much of the discussion around an article no longer takes place in the comments section. It takes place on Mastodon, Twitter, Facebook, and in links back to this post by other bloggers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are dozens of WordPress plugins and services that will scour social media for links and show pretty totals of “number of shares on Twitter”, or “Facebook likes” for the current post. Some of these involve putting tracking pixels on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Webmention\">Webmention</a> is an attempt to characterize each of these interactions. A like? That’s a webmention. A comment on social media? That’s a webmention. A retweet or repost? That’s a webmention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a definition:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/\">Webmention</a></strong> is an open web standard (<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/W3C\">W3C</a> Recommendation) for conversations and interactions across the web, a powerful building block used for a growing distributed network of peer-to-peer <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/comment\">comments</a>, <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/like\">likes</a>, <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/repost\">reposts</a>, and other <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/responses\">responses</a> across the web.</p>\n<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Webmention\">Indieweb Webmention page</a></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Webmention Examples</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been scouring bloggers’ sites to see how they use webmentions in different ways. Here are a few examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<strong>Sophie Koonin</strong> over at <a href=\"https://localghost.dev/blog/everything-should-have-an-api-adventures-in-trying-to-automate-stuff/\">LocalGhost</a> shows the entire conversation about the current post in her webmentions.<a href=\"https://mikebifulco.com/posts/semantic-html-heading-subtitle\">Mike Bifulco</a> shows both likes and full webmention comments.<a href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/\">Maggie Appleton</a> groups together likes and retweets, then show webmentions with the title of the webmentioned page. I mentioned her Digital Garden post in my <a href=\"https://adamfortuna.com/2023-02-theme\">February 2023 Theme: Garden</a> post and it shows up in her webmentions.<a href=\"https://calumryan.com/articles/weeknote-31\">Calum Ryan</a> groups webmentions by type with the ability to expand them<p>While this is still a relatively new standard, more and more blogs are implementing Webmentions. You can view a bunch of other implementations listed on the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/Webmention\">Webmention page</a> on Indieweb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s most exciting to me about webmentions is that it exists outside of social media. Links back to a blog post are also the most helpful thing that a blogger can receive for SEO purposes. It’s a win-win to use webmentions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Webmentions &amp; WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re on WordPress or using it as a headless CMS, there’s a super handy <a href=\"https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webmention\">wordpress-webmention</a> plugin by <a href=\"https://notiz.blog/\">Matthias Pfefferle</a> that you can install. The work that this plugin does is honestly amazing. I’m very happy to not have needed to build this myself. 😂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand how Webmentions work (from someone who just started wrapping my head around them), here are the three basic steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sending Webmentions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you publish a new post, your blogging software can automatically send out webmentions to all linked articles. Programmatically, you’ll need to fetch the content of each URL you link to and look for a header link like this:</p>\n\n\n<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>link</span> <span>rel</span>=<span>\"webmention\"</span> <span>href</span>=<span>\"&lt;a rel=\"</span><span>noreferrer</span> <span>noopener</span>\" <span>href</span>=<span>\"https://webmention.io/localghost.dev/webmention\"</span> <span>target</span>=<span>\"_blank\"</span>&gt;</span>https://webmention.io/localghost.dev/webmention<span>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</span>\"/&gt;</code><span>Code language:</span> <span>HTML, XML</span> <span>(</span><span>xml</span><span>)</span></pre>\n\n\n<p>Your publishing software would find this, and then make an API call to this endpoint using the webmention standard parameters.  That would let this blogger know that we’ve linked to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re using a static site generator like Jekyll, there are even <a href=\"https://aarongustafson.github.io/jekyll-webmention_io/\">gems available</a> to make these requests for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case, the <a href=\"https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webmention\">wordpress-webmention</a> plugin does this automatically – which is kind of magic. Even though I’m my WordPress is running at https://wp.adamfortuna.com, this plugin knows to use my site URL and references all links as https://adamfortuna.com. In other words, this is 100% handled by the plugin if you’re using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Receiving Webmentions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you take a look at the head tag of this page, you’ll see how I’m handling webmentions:</p>\n\n\n<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>link</span> <span>rel</span>=<span>\"webmention\"</span> <span>href</span>=<span>\"https://wp.adamfortuna.com/wp-json/webmention/1.0/endpoint\"</span>/&gt;</span>\n<span>&lt;<span>link</span> <span>rel</span>=<span>\"http://webmention.org/\"</span> <span>href</span>=<span>\"https://wp.adamfortuna.com/wp-json/webmention/1.0/endpoint\"</span>/&gt;</span></code><span>Code language:</span> <span>HTML, XML</span> <span>(</span><span>xml</span><span>)</span></pre>\n\n\n<p>Whenever someone tries to send me a webmention it’ll hit the Next.js front-end and find these links back to WordPress. This endpoint is provided by the plugin and handles creating all of the webmentions. That’s it. It’s that easy. 😂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you receive a webmention it’ll show up as a comment in WordPress. This could be a “Like” if someone liked a post on Twitter or Mastodon that linked back to the article. It could be a “Repost” if someone retweeted or reposted the link. A “Mention” if this article was linked to in another post. Or a “Comment” in cases where there’s a direct link.</p>\n\n\n\nExample comment page<p>Like any other kind of comment, we can use <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a> to monitor for spam. The webmention plugin also has an allowlist for which places you want to always approve comments from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Side note: You can also send and receive webmentions within your site. At the bottom of my <a href=\"https://adamfortuna.com/twitter-epitaph\">Twitter Epitaph</a> you can see it was linked to from my February <a href=\"https://adamfortuna.com/2023-02-theme\">2023 Theme post</a>. I’ll likely disable internal webmentions in the coming months after I verify everything is working.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Showing Webmentions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re using WordPress as usual, the plugin provides settings for how to show your webmentions after a post. In my case though, I need to fetch these from the GraphQL API and show these in Next.js. That turned out to be a little more work than I expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wordpress-webmention plugin adds additional data about the webmention that it’s able to fetch from the author. This includes the author’s name, avatar URL and a link to their website. Some of this can be extracted from an <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard\">h-card</a> on the calling page, but it’s not always guaranteed to be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the webmention data available through GraphQL, we need to add it to the GraphQL schema. WPGraphQL has a handy function called <code>register_graphql_field()</code> which can add additional data to existing objects. In this case, I wanted to add webmention URL, author URL, avatar and name to the comment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, I added the following code to my themes functions.php (which was at <code>/wp-content/themes/twentytwentytwo/functions.php</code>)</p>\n\n\n<pre><code>add_action( <span>'graphql_register_types'</span>, <span><span>function</span>(<span></span>) </span>{\n  register_graphql_object_type( <span>'Webmention'</span>, [\n    <span>'description'</span> =&gt; <span>'A Webmention outside of this site'</span>,\n    <span>'fields'</span> =&gt; [\n      <span>'author_avatar'</span> =&gt; [\n        <span>'type'</span> =&gt; <span>'String'</span>,\n        <span>'description'</span> =&gt; <span>'URL to an image of the author'</span>\n      ],\n      <span>'author_url'</span> =&gt; [\n        <span>'type'</span> =&gt; <span>'String'</span>,\n        <span>'description'</span> =&gt; <span>'URL associated with the author'</span>\n      ],\n      <span>'webmention_source_url'</span> =&gt; [\n        <span>'type'</span> =&gt; <span>'String'</span>,\n        <span>'description'</span> =&gt; <span>'The URL pointing to the URL on this site'</span>\n      ],\n      <span>'webmention_target_url'</span> =&gt; [\n        <span>'type'</span> =&gt; <span>'String'</span>,\n        <span>'description'</span> =&gt; <span>'The URL on this site associated with the Webmention'</span>\n      ],\n    ]\n  ]);\n  <span>// Forked from https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/issues/479</span>\n  register_graphql_field( <span>'Comment'</span>, <span>'webmention'</span>, [\n    <span>'type'</span> =&gt; <span>'Webmention'</span>,\n    <span>'resolve'</span> =&gt; <span><span>function</span>(<span> \\WPGraphQL\\Model\\Comment $comment, $args, $depth </span>) </span>{\n      <span>// The resolve function for the field gets passed down the Object of the Type it is resolving on. </span>\n      <span>// Since this field is registered on the `Comment` Type, it will be passed down the Comment</span>\n      <span>// object (from the WPGraphQL Model Layer), and you can use that do</span>\n      <span>// resolve the field;</span>\n      $webmention = [\n        <span>'author_avatar'</span> =&gt; get_comment_meta( $comment-&gt;comment_ID, <span>'avatar'</span>, <span>true</span> ),\n        <span>'author_url'</span> =&gt; get_comment_meta( $comment-&gt;comment_ID, <span>'url'</span>, <span>true</span> ),\n        <span>'webmention_source_url'</span> =&gt; get_comment_meta( $comment-&gt;comment_ID, <span>'webmention_source_url'</span>, <span>true</span> ),\n        <span>'webmention_target_url'</span> =&gt; get_comment_meta( $comment-&gt;comment_ID, <span>'webmention_target_url'</span>, <span>true</span> )\n      ];\n      <span>return</span> $webmention;\n    }\n  ] );\n} );</code><span>Code language:</span> <span>TypeScript</span> <span>(</span><span>typescript</span><span>)</span></pre>\n\n\n<p>Once this was added my GraphQL API now had webmention data! 🎉</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full GraphQL query I’m using to fetch these looks something like this:</p>\n\n\n<pre><code><span>export</span> <span>const</span> findWordpressPost = <span>`\nquery GetWordPressPost($slug: String!) {\n  post: postBy(slug: $slug) {\n    title\n    content\n    excerpt(format: RAW)\n    date\n    slug\n    commentStatus\n    featuredImage {\n      node {\n        sourceUrl\n        mediaDetails {\n          width\n          height\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    tags {\n      nodes {\n        name\n        slug\n      }\n    }\n    commentCount\n    comments(first: 1000) {\n      nodes {\n        type\n        databaseId\n        date\n        status\n        content(format: RAW)\n        webmention {\n          author_avatar\n          author_url\n          webmention_source_url\n          webmention_target_url\n        }\n        author {\n          node {\n            url\n            name\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  page: pageBy(uri: $slug) {\n    title\n    content\n    date\n    slug\n    featuredImage {\n      node {\n        sourceUrl\n        mediaDetails {\n          width\n          height\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n`</span></code><span>Code language:</span> <span>TypeScript</span> <span>(</span><span>typescript</span><span>)</span></pre>\n\n\n<p>At this point, the webmention data is being saved, and available to the front-end. Now we just have to use it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I opted to group together likes and reposts and then handle “mentions” and “comments” as standalone comments. For “mentions” I’m showing the first 280 characters of the URL that linked to the post. I’d love to also show the title of the post, but for that, I’ll need to make some changes to the webmention-wordpress plugin to fetch and cache those in the database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of the avatars links to the author’s URL – which in this case is usually Mastodon. The Mastodon likes are sent as webmentions thanks to <a href=\"https://brid.gy/\">Bridgy</a>. It’ll check my posts on social media and see who’s liked, reposted or replied and add ping WordPress with the webmention. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end result of all of this is that I have my own database of webmentions saved. Another popular tool I’ve seen a bunch of bloggers use is <a href=\"https://webmention.io/\">Webmention.io</a>. If you’re not using WordPress but want webmentions that route looks a lot easier than implementing it yourself – but without total ownership of your data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Current Takeaways </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m extremely happy with this setup overall. I’ve used WordPress as a Headless CMS before, but it’s always felt like a second-class citizen to the hosted version. With WPGraphQL and a site URL pointing to my public site, that’s no longer the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the steps were unexpected – like WordPress completely breaking when I changed my site URL and needing to add a <code>rest_url</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing my own formatting for posts was expected. Since I’m not using any of WordPress’s styling, I need to style my own posts. For that I’m using <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin\">Tailwind.css’s typography plugin</a>. I can add a class of “prose” on the main content and style everything in it from my <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file. That allows styling every link element that shows up in a blog post from one place.</p>\n\n\n<pre><code><span>module</span>.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    <span>require</span>(<span>'@tailwindcss/typography'</span>),\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      typography: <span>(<span><span>theme</span></span>) =&gt;</span> ({\n        DEFAULT: {\n          css: {\n            a: {\n              color: <span>'var(--tw-prose-links)'</span>,\n              fontWeight: theme(<span>'fontWeight.semibold'</span>),\n              textDecoration: <span>'underline'</span>,\n              textDecorationColor: <span>'var(--tw-prose-underline)'</span>,\n              transitionProperty: <span>'color, text-decoration-color'</span>,\n              transitionDuration: theme(<span>'transitionDuration.150'</span>),\n              transitionTimingFunction: theme(<span>'transitionTimingFunction.in-out'</span>),\n            },\n            <span>'a:hover'</span>: {\n              color: <span>'var(--tw-prose-links-hover)'</span>,\n              textDecorationColor: <span>'var(--tw-prose-underline-hover)'</span>,\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      }),\n    },\n  }\n}\n</code><span>Code language:</span> <span>TypeScript</span> <span>(</span><span>typescript</span><span>)</span></pre>\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webmention/\">wordpress-webmention plugin</a> is amazing, and you should install if if you’re using WordPress and want to bring in more conversation outside your blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than that what I’m most excited about is being able to develop the Next.js site with a reliable CMS providing all of my data from GraphQL. I originally prototyped everything using Stapi as my <a href=\"https://strapi.io/\">headless CMS</a>. It worked, but it wasn’t great for the most important piece: writing blog posts. WordPress’s editor has been top-notch since <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a>. Add to that the ability to upload images right in the editor and have them sent to a CDN and it’s tough to beat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope is to keep the WordPress side as boring as possible. I don’t need any plugins for the front end which helps. I don’t anticipate adding many more things to it other than for content organization or custom fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s Next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This site is starting to feel like a <a href=\"https://adamfortuna.com/2023-02-theme\">digital garden</a> again – growing with each little addition. Just this week I added pretty header and footer graphics. ☀️🏡</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m still working on migrating my old photo posts (like this one about my first trip to Japan) from the previous version of this blog to WordPress. For that, I’m using a combination of plugins: “PublishPress Series” for creating a series of posts and “modula” for image galleries. This’ll take a little work to implement, but I’ve already started (ex: <a href=\"https://adamfortuna.com/photos/japan\">/photos/japan</a>). Managing photos in WordPress is a breath of fresh air after years of Markdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d like to update my <a href=\"https://adamfortuna.com/projects\">Projects Page</a> eventually. Currently, all of the data is stored in a single large JSON file, and the page is generated at deployment time. It’d be nice to move this into WordPress – perhaps using a new content type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another page I’m interested in redoing is my <a href=\"https://adamfortuna.com/about\">about page</a>. It’s very basic right now, but I have an idea on how to make it a little more fun while incorporating some other important concepts of mine (like <a href=\"https://adamfortuna.com/beliefs\">my beliefs</a> and <a href=\"https://adamfortuna.com/goals\">goals</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The code snippets here aren’t styled quite how I like. They’re being generated server-side by the <a href=\"https://github.com/westonruter/syntax-highlighting-code-block\">WordPress Code block with syntax highlighting rendered on the server plugin</a>, which is welcomed. It inserts some CSS directly into the post. That allows the post to be a server component for now. If I do allow posts to be interactive (which I will eventually), I’ll have to switch the post body to be a client component.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this has been a fun project so far. We’ve been debating whether we should try Next.js’s App directory on <a href=\"https://hardcover.app\">Hardcover</a>, and at this point, I’d confidently say <strong>not yet</strong>. For starters, I struggled to cache GraphQL results with Apollo – which is a non-starter for one of the biggest benefits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also requires restructuring the entire page without using <code>&lt;context&gt;</code>‘s to share data. That will require an architectural change to make it work. We’ll keep thinking about ways to use it, but for now, the <code>pages</code> setup is working fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, I’d like to add <a href=\"https://hardcover.app/@adam\">books I’m reading</a> and <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/adamfortuna/\">movies I’m watching</a>. I doubt I’ll bring in other personal data I don’t plan to add my Mastodon posts here though – I plan to keep those separate.</p>\n\n\n\nMy daily happiness for the last month from <a href=\"https://lineofthought.com/\">Line of Thought</a> would stay separate.<p>Lastly, I’d love to do something fun and interactive here. I’m not sure yet what that’ll be but I’m keeping my eye out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Header image generated using MidJourney with the prompt “WordPress, Headless CMS, Next.js, GraphQL, flat design, unreal, symbolic, [colorful]::2, light colors, white background, [digital garden]::2 –ar 3:2 –no text”.</em></p>",
        "text": "This post that you’re reading went through a journey to get here. It was written in WordPress under an installation at wp.adamfortuna.com under my 17-year-old Dreamhost account that hosts a dozen sites for $7/month (including Hardcover and Minafi’s blogs).\n\n\n\nThis domain, adamfortuna.com, is a Next.js 13 site deployed on Vercel and using Next’s new App directory. The Next.js app uses GraphQL to query WordPress and get the latest posts and generate every page on this site ahead of time for super-speedy access.\n\n\n\nMidJourney generated image based on the title of this post (exact text at the end of this post).This is the idea behind a “Headless CMS” (Content Management System). WordPress (the headless CMS) handles the post creation and this Next.js site handles the user-facing side.\n\n\n\nOver the last decade, the Headless CMS approach has improved to the point where now it’s utterly amazing. This post will look into the different pieces needed and how they work together.\n\n\n\nWordPress Setup\n\n\n\nTo start things off, you’ll need to install WordPress (duh). I use Dreamhost for hosting my WordPress sites, with CloudFlare handling the DNS side.\n\n\n\nwp subdomain handled by Dreamhost, root domain by Vercel.Dreamhost has a one-click installer that will do everything you need – create the MySQL database, install WordPress, set up your SSL certificates – all of it. It’s easier than running WordPress locally.\n\n\n\nOnce your site is set up, you can create an account. The most important setting you’ll need to change is under Settings -> General. Keep your WordPress Address to the subdomain you’re hosting WordPress under, but change the Site Address to the site you want to be the public face.\n\n\n\nSite URL is what users will visit.This should work, but unfortunately, WordPress isn’t quite so smart. If you try to write a post you’ll receive non-stop web console errors like this:\n\n\nAccess to fetch at 'https://adamfortuna.com/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/6730?_locale=user' from origin 'https://wp.adamfortuna.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: The value of the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header in the response must not be the wildcard '*' when the request's credentials mode is 'include'.Code language: JavaScript (javascript)\n\n\nThe problem is that the WordPress admin uses “Site Address” internally for a lot of stuff. To fix this you’ll need to update the rest_url to use the home_url() rather than the site_url(). Open up the functions.php file in your WordPress theme and add this line at the bottom.\n\n\nadd_filter('rest_url', function($url) {\n  return str_replace(home_url(), site_url(), $url);\n});Code language: PHP (php)\n\n\nTo update this file you can FTP into your server or install a WordPress plugin like WP File Manager. After this is done you should be able to write posts and use WordPress as expected.\n\n\n\nWordPress API via GraphQL\n\n\n\nThe crux of all of this is being able to access your WordPress data from your Next.js (or Eleventy, etc) app. For this, you’ll need a few plugins:\n\n\n\nWPGraphQL – This is THE plugin. It’s amazing. Live it. Love it. It’ll create a GraphQL API for everything you need. You can decide to make the API public if you want to access it on the client side or limit it to authenticated users only. Since I’m generating everything on the server I’m using the authenticated API.\n\n\n\nJSON Basic Authentication – If you want to access raw excerpts, create comments or other restricted data, you’ll need to make authorized API calls.  I’ve used this plugin from a few sites and it’s solid.\n\n\n\nWPGraphQL Smart Cache – Usually with WordPress you’d want to cache the pages generated. With a headless CMS you’ll want to cache the API calls.\nSide note: Some parts of the API are only available if you’re authenticated. Post excerpts, for example, are only available in “rendered HTML” form unless you authenticate. If you need these for your meta description you’ll need to either parse the HTML or authenticate with the API.\n\n\n\nFor my setup, I decided to restrict the GraphQL API to only authenticated users. I’m building everything on the server, so there’s no reason to leave it open to the world.\n\n\n\nBefore I added pagination, I wanted to get every post in a single API call. Unfortunately, WPGraphQL has a maximum limit of 100 elements. If you’d like to increase this, open up the functions.php file for your theme and add the following to the very bottom.\n\n\n// Increase the graphql page limit\nadd_filter( 'graphql_connection_max_query_amount', function( $amount, $source, $args, $context, $info  ) {\n  $amount = 1000; // increase post limit to 1000\n  return $amount;\n}, 10, 5 );Code language: PHP (php)\n\n\nAfter that, you should be able to fetch up to 1,000 posts at once!\n\n\n\nYou can head over to the GraphiQL IDE and try a query. You can click on the avatar to run the command under your user.\n\n\n\nFetch from GraphQLNow it’s time to hit the API!\n\n\n\nUsing GraphQL from Next.js \n\n\n\nYou can pick and choose which GraphQL client you prefer. I used @apollo/client on Hardcover, but decided to use regular fetch for this site. Here’s my setup for how that works:\n\n\n\nSide note: I’m somewhat new to TypeScript. We’re using it on Hardcover, but I’m far from an expert. If you notice ways this code could be improved, you can always email me, or message me on Mastodon at @[email protected].\n\n\n\nsrc/lib/wordpressClient.ts\n\n\n\nThis is the client that’ll be used to make GraphQL calls. The hash is to create a unique URL call that way Next.js can cache the results of it. Side note: the hash likely isn’t needed, but Next.js 13 app features are still in alpha. I anticipate removing this once it’s more stable.\n\n\nimport { Md5 } from 'ts-md5'\nexport const fetchClient = ({\n  url,\n  key,\n  query,\n  variables = {},\n}: {\n  url: string\n  key: string\n  query: string\n  variables?: any\n}) => {\n  const hash = Md5.hashStr(\n    JSON.stringify({\n      ...{\n        url,\n        query,\n        key,\n      },\n      ...variables,\n    }),\n  )\n  return fetch(`${url}#${hash})}`, {\n    method: 'POST',\n    cache: 'force-cache',\n    next: {\n      revalidate: 60 * 60, // 1 hour\n    },\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      Authorization: `Basic ${key}`,\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n      query,\n      variables,\n    }),\n  }).then((res) => res.json())\n}\nexport const adamfortunaClient = ({ query, variables = {} }: { query: string; variables?: any }) => {\n  return fetchClient({\n    url: 'https://wp.adamfortuna.com/graphql',\n    key: String(process.env.WP_ADAMFORTUNA_TOKEN),\n    query,\n    variables,\n  })\n}Code language: TypeScript (typescript)\n\n\nThe WP_ADAMFORTUNA_TOKEN environment variable is a Bearer token with my username and password. I could’ve generated this here but after a few failures, I decided to just save the token.\n\n\n\nWith this, I can make a call to the API from anywhere:\n\n\nimport { adamfortunaClient } from '@/lib/wordpressClient'\nexport const findWordpressPost = `\nquery GetWordPressPost($slug: String!) {\n  post: postBy(slug: $slug) {\n    title\n}\n`\nadamfortunaClient({\n  query: findWordpressPost,\n  variables: {\n    slug: \"codeschool\"\n  }\n})Code language: TypeScript (typescript)\n\n\nThe call to adamfortunaClient will return a promise which be awaited or used with a callback passed to .then((result) => result). \n\n\n\nsrc/app/[slug]/page.tsx\n\n\n\nThis is the page you’re viewing right now. It has two responsibilities: getting the current post and preparing all possible paths.\n\n\nimport { notFound } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { Article } from '@/components/articles/Article'\nimport { getPostOrPageBySlug } from '@/queries/wordpress/getPostOrPageBySlug'\nimport { getRecentPosts } from '@/queries/wordpress/getRecentPosts'\ninterface PageProps {\n  params: {\n    slug: string\n  }\n}\nexport default async function Page({ params: { slug } }: PageProps) {\n  const article = await getPostOrPageBySlug(slug)\n  if (!article) {\n    notFound()\n  }\n  return <Article article={article} />\n}\nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  const { articles } = await getRecentPosts({\n    count: 1000\n  })\n  return articles\n    .map((article) => ({\n      slug: article.slug,\n    }))\n}\nCode language: TypeScript (typescript)\n\n\nThat’s really it. There are three important parts to this page:\n\n\n\nThe call to generateStaticParams is only run on the server by Vercel when I deploy the site. That’ll find every article that needs a standalone page and return all of their slugs. When Vercel deploys the app, it’ll create the page with that slug – hitting the API and caching the result.\n\n\n\nThe call to getPostOrPageBySlug (which I’ll show next) will find the actual article by the slug. I’m using post or page because I want to be able to create a page at the URL /about or a blog post like /40 and have a single route for both of them.\n\n\n\nLastly, render the entire article using the <Article /> component. This will output the article header, the body, author information, and webmentions.\n\n\n\nsrc/queries/wordpress/getPostOrPageBySlug.ts\n\n\n\nThe last piece is the script that’ll set up the GraphQL calls and parse the response into types your app expects. In my case, I created an Article type. I’m skipping over the parsePage and parsePost functions, but those just take the result from the GraphQL query and return an object.\n\n\nimport { adamfortunaClient, parsePage, parsePost } from '@/lib/wordpressClient'\nexport const findWordpressPost = `\nquery GetWordPressPost($slug: String!) {\n  post: postBy(slug: $slug) {\n    title\n    content\n    excerpt(format: RAW)\n    date\n    slug\n    featuredImage {\n      node {\n        sourceUrl\n        mediaDetails {\n          width\n          height\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    tags {\n      nodes {\n        name\n        slug\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  page: pageBy(uri: $slug) {\n    title\n    content\n    date\n    slug\n    featuredImage {\n      node {\n        sourceUrl\n        mediaDetails {\n          width\n          height\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n`\nexport const getPostOrPageBySlug = (slug: string) => {\n  return adamfortunaClient({\n    query: findWordpressPost,\n    variables: {\n      slug,\n    },\n  }).then((result) => {\n    if (!result.data.post && !result.data.page) {\n      return null\n    }\n    if (result.data.post) {\n      return parsePost(\n        {\n          ...result.data.post,\n          project: 'adamfortuna',\n        },\n        true,\n      )\n    }\n    if (result.data.page) {\n      return parsePage({\n        ...result.data.page,\n        project: 'adamfortuna',\n      })\n    }\n    return null\n  })\n}Code language: TypeScript (typescript)\n\n\nThere’s a lot going on here. Most of it is just a regular GraphQL query. I’ve learned to love GraphQL for projects like this. I can specify exactly what I want the API to return, even nesting arrays and objects multiple levels deep.\n\n\n\nThe WPGraphQL WordPress plugin has settings for depth limit which is handy if you’re making this API public.\n\n\n\nOne thing to note here: The Post is looked up by “slug”, while the Page is looked up by “uri”. This is by design. I’m in the process of moving over some old photo posts from my previous Middleman blog. This type of lookup allows pages like /photos/japan to be handled by this same query (although that needs a route at [...slug] as the root route).\n\n\n\nsrc/app/[slug]/head.tsx\n\n\n\nNext.js 13 has an amazing new addition: head files. These will run during the same page load as your page and populate the <head> of the page. This is needed for the OpenGraph tags. \n\n\nimport { notFound } from 'next/navigation'\nimport { getPostOrPageBySlug } from '@/queries/wordpress/getPostOrPageBySlug'\nimport ArticleMetadata from '@/components/articles/ArticleMetadata'\nimport GlobalHead from '../globalHead'\nconst Head = async ({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) => {\n  const article = await getPostOrPageBySlug(params.slug)\n  if (!article) {\n    notFound()\n  }\n  return (\n    <>\n      <title>{article.title}</title>\n      <GlobalHead />\n      <ArticleMetadata article={article} />\n    </>\n  )\n}\nexport default HeadCode language: TypeScript (typescript)\n\n\nYou’ll notice that both the page.ts and the head.ts files both use the same getPostOrPageBySlug query. This is where it becomes handy that Next.js caches the fetch call. \n\n\n\nThe head contains about what you’d expect:\n\n\n\nsrc/app/globalHead.tsx\n\n\nconst GlobalHead = () => {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n      <link href=\"/favicon.ico\" rel=\"shortcut icon\" />\n      <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" href=\"https://feeds.feedburner.com/adamfortuna\" />\n      <link href=\"https://github.com/adamfortuna\" rel=\"me\" />\n      <link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://wp.adamfortuna.com/wp-json/webmention/1.0/endpoint\" />\n      <link rel=\"http://webmention.org/\" href=\"https://wp.adamfortuna.com/wp-json/webmention/1.0/endpoint\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\nexport default GlobalHeadCode language: TypeScript (typescript)\n\n\nsrc/components/articles/ArticleMetadata.ts\n\n\n\nAnd lastly the article metadata. I originally wanted to use next-seo for this. That module uses next/head to add the header info, which isn’t compatible with Next.js 13’s new app directory. Instead, we can do this manually.\n\n\nimport { Article } from '@/types'\nconst ArticleMetadata = ({ article }: { article: Article }) => (\n  <>\n    <meta property=\"og:title\" content={article.title} />\n    <meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" />\n    <meta property=\"og:url\" content={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL}/${article.slug}`} />\n    {article.featuredImage && (\n      <>\n        <meta property=\"og:image\" content={article.featuredImage.sourceUrl} />\n        {article.featuredImage.mediaDetails && (\n          <>\n            <meta property=\"og:image:width\" content={String(article.featuredImage.mediaDetails.width)} />\n            <meta property=\"og:image:height\" content={String(article.featuredImage.mediaDetails.height)} />\n          </>\n        )}\n      </>\n    )}\n    <meta property=\"og:description\" content={article.excerpt || article.title} />\n    <meta name=\"description\" content={article.excerpt || article.title} />\n    <meta property=\"article:published_time\" content={article.date} />\n    <meta property=\"article:author\" content=\"Adam Fortuna\" />\n    <meta property=\"article:section\" content=\"Technology\" />\n    {article.tags && article.tags.length > 0 && (\n      <meta property=\"article:tag\" content={article.tags?.map((t) => t.name).join(',')} />\n    )}\n    <meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary\" />\n    <meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@adamfortuna\" />\n  </>\n)\nexport default ArticleMetadata\nCode language: TypeScript (typescript)\n\n\nSome of this is hardcoded because this blog doesn’t have multiple authors. You could just as easily fetch author data from the WordPress API and fill that in here.\n\n\n\nSeeing it in Action\n\n\n\nWith this running, you can see the page you’re looking at right now! Since this blog will likely change over time, I’ll save a snapshot of what it looks like today:\n\n\n\nA sample screenshot of how this looks today.And with that, we have a blog page on Next.js 13, backed by a headless WordPress GraphQL API that’s generated and available.\n\n\n\nWebmentions\n\n\n\nThe last step of this journey (so far) was the question of how to handle comments. On my investing and FIRE blog I went with traditional comments. People could enter their name, email and optionally a URL and it’d show up as a comment. Super-basic, the same way comments have worked since the turn of the millennia.\n\n\n\nBut there’s a problem with comments. Much of the discussion around an article no longer takes place in the comments section. It takes place on Mastodon, Twitter, Facebook, and in links back to this post by other bloggers. \n\n\n\nThere are dozens of WordPress plugins and services that will scour social media for links and show pretty totals of “number of shares on Twitter”, or “Facebook likes” for the current post. Some of these involve putting tracking pixels on your site.\n\n\n\nA Webmention is an attempt to characterize each of these interactions. A like? That’s a webmention. A comment on social media? That’s a webmention. A retweet or repost? That’s a webmention.\n\n\n\nHere’s a definition:\n\n\n\n\nWebmention is an open web standard (W3C Recommendation) for conversations and interactions across the web, a powerful building block used for a growing distributed network of peer-to-peer comments, likes, reposts, and other responses across the web.\nIndieweb Webmention page\n\n\n\nWebmention Examples\n\n\n\nI’ve been scouring bloggers’ sites to see how they use webmentions in different ways. Here are a few examples.\n\n\n\nSophie Koonin over at LocalGhost shows the entire conversation about the current post in her webmentions.Mike Bifulco shows both likes and full webmention comments.Maggie Appleton groups together likes and retweets, then show webmentions with the title of the webmentioned page. I mentioned her Digital Garden post in my February 2023 Theme: Garden post and it shows up in her webmentions.Calum Ryan groups webmentions by type with the ability to expand themWhile this is still a relatively new standard, more and more blogs are implementing Webmentions. You can view a bunch of other implementations listed on the Webmention page on Indieweb.\n\n\n\nWhat’s most exciting to me about webmentions is that it exists outside of social media. Links back to a blog post are also the most helpful thing that a blogger can receive for SEO purposes. It’s a win-win to use webmentions.\n\n\n\nWebmentions & WordPress\n\n\n\nIf you’re on WordPress or using it as a headless CMS, there’s a super handy wordpress-webmention plugin by Matthias Pfefferle that you can install. The work that this plugin does is honestly amazing. I’m very happy to not have needed to build this myself. 😂\n\n\n\nTo understand how Webmentions work (from someone who just started wrapping my head around them), here are the three basic steps:\n\n\n\nSending Webmentions\n\n\n\nWhen you publish a new post, your blogging software can automatically send out webmentions to all linked articles. Programmatically, you’ll need to fetch the content of each URL you link to and look for a header link like this:\n\n\n<link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://webmention.io/localghost.dev/webmention\" target=\"_blank\">https://webmention.io/localghost.dev/webmention</a>\"/>Code language: HTML, XML (xml)\n\n\nYour publishing software would find this, and then make an API call to this endpoint using the webmention standard parameters.  That would let this blogger know that we’ve linked to them.\n\n\n\nIf you’re using a static site generator like Jekyll, there are even gems available to make these requests for you.\n\n\n\nIn my case, the wordpress-webmention plugin does this automatically – which is kind of magic. Even though I’m my WordPress is running at https://wp.adamfortuna.com, this plugin knows to use my site URL and references all links as https://adamfortuna.com. In other words, this is 100% handled by the plugin if you’re using WordPress.\n\n\n\nReceiving Webmentions\n\n\n\nIf you take a look at the head tag of this page, you’ll see how I’m handling webmentions:\n\n\n<link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://wp.adamfortuna.com/wp-json/webmention/1.0/endpoint\"/>\n<link rel=\"http://webmention.org/\" href=\"https://wp.adamfortuna.com/wp-json/webmention/1.0/endpoint\"/>Code language: HTML, XML (xml)\n\n\nWhenever someone tries to send me a webmention it’ll hit the Next.js front-end and find these links back to WordPress. This endpoint is provided by the plugin and handles creating all of the webmentions. That’s it. It’s that easy. 😂\n\n\n\nWhen you receive a webmention it’ll show up as a comment in WordPress. This could be a “Like” if someone liked a post on Twitter or Mastodon that linked back to the article. It could be a “Repost” if someone retweeted or reposted the link. A “Mention” if this article was linked to in another post. Or a “Comment” in cases where there’s a direct link.\n\n\n\nExample comment pageLike any other kind of comment, we can use Akismet to monitor for spam. The webmention plugin also has an allowlist for which places you want to always approve comments from.\n\n\n\nSide note: You can also send and receive webmentions within your site. At the bottom of my Twitter Epitaph you can see it was linked to from my February 2023 Theme post. I’ll likely disable internal webmentions in the coming months after I verify everything is working.\n\n\n\nShowing Webmentions\n\n\n\nIf you’re using WordPress as usual, the plugin provides settings for how to show your webmentions after a post. In my case though, I need to fetch these from the GraphQL API and show these in Next.js. That turned out to be a little more work than I expected.\n\n\n\nThe wordpress-webmention plugin adds additional data about the webmention that it’s able to fetch from the author. This includes the author’s name, avatar URL and a link to their website. Some of this can be extracted from an h-card on the calling page, but it’s not always guaranteed to be there.\n\n\n\nTo make the webmention data available through GraphQL, we need to add it to the GraphQL schema. WPGraphQL has a handy function called register_graphql_field() which can add additional data to existing objects. In this case, I wanted to add webmention URL, author URL, avatar and name to the comment. \n\n\n\nTo do this, I added the following code to my themes functions.php (which was at /wp-content/themes/twentytwentytwo/functions.php)\n\n\nadd_action( 'graphql_register_types', function() {\n  register_graphql_object_type( 'Webmention', [\n    'description' => 'A Webmention outside of this site',\n    'fields' => [\n      'author_avatar' => [\n        'type' => 'String',\n        'description' => 'URL to an image of the author'\n      ],\n      'author_url' => [\n        'type' => 'String',\n        'description' => 'URL associated with the author'\n      ],\n      'webmention_source_url' => [\n        'type' => 'String',\n        'description' => 'The URL pointing to the URL on this site'\n      ],\n      'webmention_target_url' => [\n        'type' => 'String',\n        'description' => 'The URL on this site associated with the Webmention'\n      ],\n    ]\n  ]);\n  // Forked from https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/issues/479\n  register_graphql_field( 'Comment', 'webmention', [\n    'type' => 'Webmention',\n    'resolve' => function( \\WPGraphQL\\Model\\Comment $comment, $args, $depth ) {\n      // The resolve function for the field gets passed down the Object of the Type it is resolving on. \n      // Since this field is registered on the `Comment` Type, it will be passed down the Comment\n      // object (from the WPGraphQL Model Layer), and you can use that do\n      // resolve the field;\n      $webmention = [\n        'author_avatar' => get_comment_meta( $comment->comment_ID, 'avatar', true ),\n        'author_url' => get_comment_meta( $comment->comment_ID, 'url', true ),\n        'webmention_source_url' => get_comment_meta( $comment->comment_ID, 'webmention_source_url', true ),\n        'webmention_target_url' => get_comment_meta( $comment->comment_ID, 'webmention_target_url', true )\n      ];\n      return $webmention;\n    }\n  ] );\n} );Code language: TypeScript (typescript)\n\n\nOnce this was added my GraphQL API now had webmention data! 🎉\n\n\n\nThe full GraphQL query I’m using to fetch these looks something like this:\n\n\nexport const findWordpressPost = `\nquery GetWordPressPost($slug: String!) {\n  post: postBy(slug: $slug) {\n    title\n    content\n    excerpt(format: RAW)\n    date\n    slug\n    commentStatus\n    featuredImage {\n      node {\n        sourceUrl\n        mediaDetails {\n          width\n          height\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    tags {\n      nodes {\n        name\n        slug\n      }\n    }\n    commentCount\n    comments(first: 1000) {\n      nodes {\n        type\n        databaseId\n        date\n        status\n        content(format: RAW)\n        webmention {\n          author_avatar\n          author_url\n          webmention_source_url\n          webmention_target_url\n        }\n        author {\n          node {\n            url\n            name\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  page: pageBy(uri: $slug) {\n    title\n    content\n    date\n    slug\n    featuredImage {\n      node {\n        sourceUrl\n        mediaDetails {\n          width\n          height\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n`Code language: TypeScript (typescript)\n\n\nAt this point, the webmention data is being saved, and available to the front-end. Now we just have to use it!\n\n\n\nI opted to group together likes and reposts and then handle “mentions” and “comments” as standalone comments. For “mentions” I’m showing the first 280 characters of the URL that linked to the post. I’d love to also show the title of the post, but for that, I’ll need to make some changes to the webmention-wordpress plugin to fetch and cache those in the database.\n\n\n\nEach of the avatars links to the author’s URL – which in this case is usually Mastodon. The Mastodon likes are sent as webmentions thanks to Bridgy. It’ll check my posts on social media and see who’s liked, reposted or replied and add ping WordPress with the webmention. \n\n\n\nThe end result of all of this is that I have my own database of webmentions saved. Another popular tool I’ve seen a bunch of bloggers use is Webmention.io. If you’re not using WordPress but want webmentions that route looks a lot easier than implementing it yourself – but without total ownership of your data.\n\n\n\nCurrent Takeaways \n\n\n\nI’m extremely happy with this setup overall. I’ve used WordPress as a Headless CMS before, but it’s always felt like a second-class citizen to the hosted version. With WPGraphQL and a site URL pointing to my public site, that’s no longer the case.\n\n\n\nSome of the steps were unexpected – like WordPress completely breaking when I changed my site URL and needing to add a rest_url.\n\n\n\nWriting my own formatting for posts was expected. Since I’m not using any of WordPress’s styling, I need to style my own posts. For that I’m using Tailwind.css’s typography plugin. I can add a class of “prose” on the main content and style everything in it from my tailwind.config.js file. That allows styling every link element that shows up in a blog post from one place.\n\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      typography: (theme) => ({\n        DEFAULT: {\n          css: {\n            a: {\n              color: 'var(--tw-prose-links)',\n              fontWeight: theme('fontWeight.semibold'),\n              textDecoration: 'underline',\n              textDecorationColor: 'var(--tw-prose-underline)',\n              transitionProperty: 'color, text-decoration-color',\n              transitionDuration: theme('transitionDuration.150'),\n              transitionTimingFunction: theme('transitionTimingFunction.in-out'),\n            },\n            'a:hover': {\n              color: 'var(--tw-prose-links-hover)',\n              textDecorationColor: 'var(--tw-prose-underline-hover)',\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      }),\n    },\n  }\n}\nCode language: TypeScript (typescript)\n\n\nThe wordpress-webmention plugin is amazing, and you should install if if you’re using WordPress and want to bring in more conversation outside your blog.\n\n\n\nOther than that what I’m most excited about is being able to develop the Next.js site with a reliable CMS providing all of my data from GraphQL. I originally prototyped everything using Stapi as my headless CMS. It worked, but it wasn’t great for the most important piece: writing blog posts. WordPress’s editor has been top-notch since Gutenberg. Add to that the ability to upload images right in the editor and have them sent to a CDN and it’s tough to beat.\n\n\n\nMy hope is to keep the WordPress side as boring as possible. I don’t need any plugins for the front end which helps. I don’t anticipate adding many more things to it other than for content organization or custom fields.\n\n\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\n\n\nThis site is starting to feel like a digital garden again – growing with each little addition. Just this week I added pretty header and footer graphics. ☀️🏡\n\n\n\nI’m still working on migrating my old photo posts (like this one about my first trip to Japan) from the previous version of this blog to WordPress. For that, I’m using a combination of plugins: “PublishPress Series” for creating a series of posts and “modula” for image galleries. This’ll take a little work to implement, but I’ve already started (ex: /photos/japan). Managing photos in WordPress is a breath of fresh air after years of Markdown.\n\n\n\nI’d like to update my Projects Page eventually. Currently, all of the data is stored in a single large JSON file, and the page is generated at deployment time. It’d be nice to move this into WordPress – perhaps using a new content type.\n\n\n\nAnother page I’m interested in redoing is my about page. It’s very basic right now, but I have an idea on how to make it a little more fun while incorporating some other important concepts of mine (like my beliefs and goals).\n\n\n\nThe code snippets here aren’t styled quite how I like. They’re being generated server-side by the WordPress Code block with syntax highlighting rendered on the server plugin, which is welcomed. It inserts some CSS directly into the post. That allows the post to be a server component for now. If I do allow posts to be interactive (which I will eventually), I’ll have to switch the post body to be a client component.\n\n\n\nAll of this has been a fun project so far. We’ve been debating whether we should try Next.js’s App directory on Hardcover, and at this point, I’d confidently say not yet. For starters, I struggled to cache GraphQL results with Apollo – which is a non-starter for one of the biggest benefits. \n\n\n\nIt also requires restructuring the entire page without using <context>‘s to share data. That will require an architectural change to make it work. We’ll keep thinking about ways to use it, but for now, the pages setup is working fine.\n\n\n\nEventually, I’d like to add books I’m reading and movies I’m watching. I doubt I’ll bring in other personal data I don’t plan to add my Mastodon posts here though – I plan to keep those separate.\n\n\n\nMy daily happiness for the last month from Line of Thought would stay separate.Lastly, I’d love to do something fun and interactive here. I’m not sure yet what that’ll be but I’m keeping my eye out.\n\n\n\nHeader image generated using MidJourney with the prompt “WordPress, Headless CMS, Next.js, GraphQL, flat design, unreal, symbolic, [colorful]::2, light colors, white background, [digital garden]::2 –ar 3:2 –no text”."
