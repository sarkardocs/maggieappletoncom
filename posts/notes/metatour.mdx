[Jared Pereira](https://awarm.space/) has been running a wonderful series of personal [website tours](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEXbN99LY3OCarUeXcxWeZzOelXQvVdAA). The guest list features many of my favourite [[Digital Gardeners]] and [indie web](https://indieweb.org/) creators such as [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/), [Chris Aldrich](https://boffosocko.com/), and [Azlen Elza](https://azlen.me/).

At the end of 2020 I stopped in to show what this website looks like behind the Wizard of Oz curtain:

The video walkthrough on this page walks through how I built my [previous
website](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/maggieappleton.com) in Gatsby.js. To learn about the tech stack behind the current
version visit the

### Tech Stack and Features

- Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) for rendering and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for data fetching
- All posts (notes, essays, books) written with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) - allows me to write React components inside markdown files for extra JavaScript power ‚ú®
- I use the CSS-in-JS library [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for styling components
- Responsive footnotes implemented with [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) (no JavaScript required!)
- [[Bi-Directional Links]] with <a href="https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/gatsby-theme-brain">gatsby-theme-brain</a>, and page previews adapted from <a href="https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy">gatsby-theme-andy</a>
- [Tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/) for tooltip popovers
- Images hosted on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to avoid the long build times when using [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/)
- Deploys to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) directly from Github. Currently takes 4 minutes for the site to build and deploy. I have no idea if that's good or not, but I'll take it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
