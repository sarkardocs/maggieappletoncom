<IntroParagraph>

G[raphQL](https://graphql.org/) is undoubtedly one of the popular kids on the Web Development playground right now. If you haven't heard of GraphQL, the TLDR is that it's a new way to request data from an API. <Footnote idName={1}>If you're unsure what an API is, head on over to my illustrated article on [WTF is an API?](/api)</Footnote> One that's easier, faster, better, and stronger than the old [RESTful API system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)

If you're lucky enough to already grok GraphQL, you'll know the _QL_ stands for _Query Language_ – aka. the language we talk to our GraphQL API in.

It's not a terribly complex language, but you'll still need to do some syntax studying to get the hang of it.

Thankfully the magnificent [Eve Porcello](https://twitter.com/eveporcello) made an [egghead course](https://egghead.io/courses/graphql-query-language) that runs you through the full GraphQL vocabulary.

It's a wonderful introduction for anyone new to the GraphQL ecosystem – Eve explains all the parts of the playground interface that are not in the least bit intuitive. I'd been stumbling about in my own GraphQL queries lost and afraid until I worked through this.

Anyways, as usual I drew some things:

  alt="A query is a request for data. We open it with the query keyword and a set of curly braces. Curly braces wrap around a selection and say go look inside this object. Blank spaces at the end of a line are fields that say I want his data please. We can also add the 'total' and 'all' keywords in front of any list of objects."

Twitter kept bugging me to make prints out of these illustrated notes, so this one is now purchaseable as a real life object on the [egghead store](https://store.egghead.io/).

There's framed versions and unframed, depending on how fancy you feel. You can [buy one here](https://store.egghead.io/product/poster-graphql-query-language) if you so desire.
