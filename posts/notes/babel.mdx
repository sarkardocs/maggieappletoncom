<IntroParagraph>

If you've build anything on the modern web, you've used [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). Nothing works without it. When I first started learning web development I didn't pay much attention to it. But once I got deeper into learning [[JSX]] and React (more on that in my [[React is a Potato]] talk) and I needed a to understand what was up with the all the `.babelrc` files in my projects.
