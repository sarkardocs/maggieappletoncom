[xState](https://xstate.js.org/) is a snazzy way to manage JavaScript application state using visual state charts.
It's a pretty wonderful tool for making sure you think through every possible edge case of an application.

There's also a handy [visualiser tool](https://xstate.js.org/viz/) that synchronizes your code and visuals. If you edit one, the other changes to match. <span aria-role="image">âœ¨</span>

It's perfect for visual thinkers. If someone could just build one of these for the entire of JavaScript I'll be all set.

Here's a little more illustrated detail on how this works:

If you're keen to learn more xState there's two courses up on egghead that cover all the basics:
