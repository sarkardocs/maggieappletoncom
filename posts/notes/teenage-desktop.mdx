<IntroParagraph>

During my last year of high school, I kept a screenshot record of every time I redesigned my desktop.

</IntroParagraph>

It was 2009 and we were in the heydey of [skeuomorphism](https://medium.com/design-warp/skeuomorphism-design-we-learned-to-outgrow-8a24895a80d0) and bespoke wallpapers made in bootlegged versions of Photoshop. MacOS [Snow Leopard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard) has just been released, featuring a glossy 3D dock stacked with richly detailed icons.

Meticulously detailed icons became _the thing_. [The Icon Factory](https://design.iconfactory.com/) were at the peak of their game making bespoke [icon sets](https://freeware.iconfactory.com/icons). Designers like [David Lanham](https://dlanham.com/), [Anthony Piraino](https://anthonypiraino.com/), and [Louie Mantia](https://louiemantia.com/) were part of the team who created the official [Windows XP icons](https://web.archive.org/web/20060821175816/http://iconfactory.com/design/detail/windows_xp), as well as plenty of pop-culture icon sets like the [Wall·E](https://freeware.iconfactory.com/preview/walle) and [Star Trek](https://freeware.iconfactory.com/preview/trxi) series.

I followed this work obsessively. Every few weeks I would “redesign” my Macbook desktop with a newly found wallpaper, icon set, and layout. And then for posterity, screenshot it. This eventually led to creating my own wallpapers and icons, and heavily influenced my hyper-detailed [illustration style](/egghead-courses) later on.

I recently found that screenshot archive, and it is a treat! Teenage me left a series of scene-setting details in each shot – music tracks currently playing in iTunes, a CD being burned, a PDF with plane tickets, college course catalogues, a code editor featuring HTML tables (ugh), TV shows I was in the middle of binge-watching, CVs and applications for some New York Times internship I failed to land<Footnote idName={1}>I have no recollection of this, but I'm guessing it was a photography gig. At the time I had my heart set on war photojournalism. I'm glad that didn't last long.</Footnote>

It's the millennial equivalent of a physical scrapbook – but with digital detritus rather than ticket stubs, handwritten notes, and polaroids. Looking through these, I feel overwhelming nostalgia. But also loss. I took so few. I captured so little of my digital environment. The design aesthetics of this time are mostly gone, save for a few snapshots on [internet archive](https://archive.org/).

I'm still thankful for these scraps.

You can still download many of the gorgeous wallpapers and icons shown here. My favourites are from [Louie](http://louie.world/wallpapers/), [David](https://dlanham.com/), and the Icon Factory [archives](https://freeware.iconfactory.com/). I'm sure Pinterest is also full of assets for this kind of interior decoration.
