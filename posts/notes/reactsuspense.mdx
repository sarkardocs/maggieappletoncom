This is a pretty lightweight intro, but you get the gist of it. CSS-Tricks has a nice in-depth write up on [React Suspense in Practice](https://css-tricks.com/react-suspense-in-practice/)

If you're looking to properly learn how React suspense works, [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) and [Michael Chan](https://twitter.com/chantastic) both made egghead courses on it
