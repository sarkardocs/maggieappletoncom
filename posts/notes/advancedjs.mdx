<IntroParagraph>

Being humans, we rarely learn things linearly. No one begins their JavaScript journey by reading [the TC39 language specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) line-by-line like a pedantic masochist.

</IntroParagraph>

```js
let banana = "banana";
let apple = "apple";

console.log(banana);
console.log(apple);
```

Instead we all cobble together a good-enough understanding, leaving holes here and there to fill in later.

So far I've stumbled along without 100% grokking prototypical inheritance, or how `call, apply,` and `bind` work on functions.

It's fine. Stuff mostly works. Until it doesn't ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

But at some point, it's useful to stop stumbling about and peek back at those holes.

[Tyler Clark](https://twitter.com/iamtylerwclark)'s egghead course on [Advanced JavaScript Foundations](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-javascript-foundations) that was exactly that hole-filling opportunity for me.

As usual, I drew some notes...
