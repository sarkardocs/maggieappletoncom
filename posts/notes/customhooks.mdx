<IntroParagraph>

Last year the [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) team released a feature called "hooks" that lets you do some powerful stuff we couldn't do as easily before... Managing state. Accessing DOM elements. Using side effects.

</IntroParagraph>

It's fair to say the React community had a collective melt-down over this. For the better part of 2019, hooks turned into an all-encompassing obsession.

Hooks came with a bunch of pre-made options, but also allowed you to remix the default options to create **custom hooks**
