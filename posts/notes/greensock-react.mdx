<IntroParagraph>

Using the [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) web animation library (also known as gsap) in vanilla JavaScript isn't too complex. But when we want it to play nicely with a frontend framework like React, we run into some finicky issues.

</IntroParagraph>

This guide is specifically about using React Hooks with GreenSock, as many of the [existing guides](https://greensock.com/react/) only explain how to set it up with the old style of class components.

This isn't an introduction to the GreenSock library itself â€“ head over to my post on [[The Bare Essentials of Greensock]] for that.

<br />

## React, Meet GreenSock

The issue with combining these two libraries is that React acts as a DOM interloper â€“ it sits between the code we write and the DOM, managing it for us.

React builds it's own internal "tree" of DOM nodes based off our code, and only updates the actual DOM as needed (a concept previously known as the [[React Virtual DOM]]) <Footnote idName={1}>The React team has gone off the term of the _virtual DOM_ and prefer to talk about the _render tree_. Potatoes, potataos. For more on how the virtual DOM works, I have an [illustrated guide](/react-vdom)</Footnote>

<BasicImage

/>

Meanwhile, the GreenSock library usually works by directly animating our DOM elements. Perhaps you can sense the tension in the room...

Since the GreenSock library needs access to the DOM in order to animate it, we need to tell React about our Greensock animations. Otherwise the two end up in awkward arguments that can end in tears (primarily mine).

## Bring in the React Hooks

There's two essential React hooks we'll use to connect our React code to our Greensock code: **useRef** and **useEffect**

<SimpleCard>

**useRef** lets us access and directly target our DOM nodes

**useEffect** lets us to perform side effects â€“ any functions or data requests that we want to run _after_ rendering the component to the DOM

</SimpleCard>

If you're not completely comfortable with [React Hooks](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/beginners-guide-to-using-react-hooks/) yet and those technical explanations mean nothing to you, don't worry we're going to slowly walk through this. With illustrations. Because who the fork properly understands _"side effects"_?

### Getting Setup

We first need to run `yarn install gsap` or `npm install gsap` into our React project repo <Footnote idName={2}>**gsap** is short for _GreenSock Animation Platform_ and it's the way we reference the Greensock library in all our code sytax</Footnote>

<SimpleCard>

Feel free to open up a Codesandbox project to work through the steps while you read. I've set one up for you with React and Greensock already installed:

</SimpleCard>

<br />

### Building our Animation Component

Let's start by creating a React component called `<AnimatedBox/>` that is going to hold all our Greensock code. We're going to build a simple `<div>` element and have it animate across the page (exciting!).

We'll need to import the Greensock library into our component with `import { gsap }from 'gsap'`, as well as React and our two hooks with `import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'`

```js
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import { gsap } from "gsap";

const Animation = () => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        width: "160px",
        height: "160px",
        background: "salmon",
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

I've set some basic width, height, and color CSS styles on our div to make
it visible on the page.

<p>
  <div
    style={{
      margin: "2em auto",
      width: "120px",
      height: "120px",
      background: "salmon",
      borderRadius: "4px",
    }}
  />
</p>

<Center>

Good looking div, right? Salmon is always the right color choice.

</Center>

## Adding the useRef Hook

We're now going to add _references_ to our animation with the **useRef** hook.

We create a new reference by adding `const boxRef = useRef()` anywhere outside of our return statement. Call it anything you like, but _boxRef_ is a good enough name for this example.

We then add a `ref={boxRef}` attribute on our `<div>` element.

```js
const Animation = () => {
  const boxRef = useRef();

  return (
    <div
      ref={boxRef}
      style={{
        width: "120px",
        height: "120px",
        background: "salmon",
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

This tells React we want to be able to control our `<div>` element with the `boxRef` reference once our component is mounted onto the DOM.

---

## Adding the useEffect Hook

Next we're going to add our **useEffect** hook, and write our GreenSock animation inside of it.

If you're already familiar with greensock this will look fairly straightforward.

```js
const Animation = () => {
  const boxRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    gsap.to([boxRef.current], {
      x: "400px",
      duration: 2,
    });
  });

  return (
    <div
      ref={boxRef}
      style={{
        width: "120px",
        height: "120px",
        background: "salmon",
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

We declare a normal `gsap.to()` tween, but instead of passing in an id or class name as the target element, we use `[boxRef.current]`.

This means we want gsap to animate the `.current` property of our `boxRef` reference â€“ which is the `<div>` element we put that reference on.

```js
gsap.to([boxRef.current], {});
```

We then pass in our variables object, which tells Greensock to move our div 400px along the _x_ axis over a duration of 2 seconds:

```js
{ x: 400px, duration: 2 }
```

And thus, our div animates...

<p>

<Tween
  to={{
    scrollTrigger: {
      trigger: "#boxRef",
      start: "top 60%",
      end: "+=500",
      scrub: true,
    },
    x: "400%",
  }}
  duration={2}
  ease="back.out(1.3)"
>
  <div
    id="boxRef"
    style={{
      margin: "2em",
      width: "120px",
      height: "120px",
      background: "salmon",
      borderRadius: "4px",
    }}
  />
</Tween>

</p>

<Center>

# Tada <span>ðŸŽ‰</span>

</Center>

So by this point, you hopefully have a working animation in that [Codesandbox project](https://codesandbox.io/s/reacthooks-greensock-demo-xjoti?file=/src/AnimatedBox.js) or a local repo.

If you don't feel like mucking around with **useRef** and **useEffect**, [John Lindquist](https://johnlindquist.com/use-greensock-with-react-hooks/) created a simple React hook called **use-gsap** that hides them away.
