<IntroParagraph>

If you've been keeping up with the sweetest new static-site generation tools, you'll have heard of the JAMstack. <Footnote idName={1}>And if you havent, don't worry it's a niche web developer thing - <a href="https://jamstack.wtf/">Jamstack WTF</a> explains it pretty well.</Footnote>

</IntroParagraph>

The TLDR here is that combining JavaScript, APIs, and Markup (JAM) makes it easy to build sites that work well across all kinds of devices and data loading speeds. Which, like jam, makes everyone happy.

Two popular tools for building JAMstack sites are [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/). Gatsby is a framework for building the actual site, and Contentful is a Content Management System (CMS) - aka. where you stick all the images, text, and data.

[Khaled Garbaya](https://khaledgarbaya.net/) created a whole [egghead course](https://egghead.io/courses/build-content-rich-progressive-web-apps-with-gatsby-and-contentful) that walks you through hooking these two up

Here's some notes I took while working through it...
